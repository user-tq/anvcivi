Mutations in DNMT3A have largely been associated with poorer prognosis, however this is not consistent across all studies. This may be a result of patient age or combining R882 and non-R882 mutations during analysis as studies have indicated independent mechanisms of action and differential prognostic implications for these mutation types. One study that independently analyzed R882 and non-R882 mutations showed R882 mutations were associated with poorer prognosis than patients with wildtype and non-R882 mutations, but only in older patients with AML.

Of the cell lines tested, six harbored BRAF V600E (and WT KRAS) and three harbored BRAF WT (but mutant KRAS). Of the six BRAF V600E expressing cell lines, four were sensitive to vemurafenib (IC50 ranging between 0.025 and 0.35 uM; HT29, Colo205, Colo741, LS411N). Cell lines expressing the BRAF V600E mutation responded better to vemurafenib treatment than cells wildtype for BRAF as measured by reduced cellular proliferation and inhibition of MET and ERK phosphorylation (none of the three BRAF wt cell lines had IC50s less than 10uM). Authors note that one of the vemurafenib-resistant cell lines harboring BRAF V600E (RKO) harbored a concurrent activating PIK3CA H1047R mutation. Nude, athymic mice with HT29 xenografts treated with vemurafenib experienced substantial tumor inhibition and increased lifespan at every dose tested, though authors found 75 mg/kg twice daily to be optimal (95% tumor growth inhibition, 90% increased lifespan compared to vehicle treated controls).	22180495(PubMed)	PubMed		Yang et al., 2012, Cancer Res.		2.0	accepted	99	12	5	7	140453136.0	140453136.0	A	T	ENST00000288602.6					75.0	GRCh37	BRAF V600E has been shown to be recurrent in many cancer types.

One patient (who harbored BRAF V600E in low copy number) responded, 11 had stable disease, and 18 progressed.

Due to their high frequency, NPM1 mutations have been retrospectively analyzed in the context of a number of therapies including variable results following ATRA treatment as well as improved response to high-dose daunorubicin or valproic acid. Additionally, multiple groups have shown increased surface expression of CD33 associated with NPM1 mutation, suggesting these patients may respond to anti-CD33 therapy. Cytoplasmic sequestration of NPM1 (NPM1c) is associated with a good response to induction therapy.

It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, despite its ability to initiate disease in mice, its status as an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response. Third generation ABL1 inhibitor ponatinib is the only FDA approved drug with activity against T315I . However due to risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels ponatinib is ONLY approved for T315I-positive CML or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL or in cases of CML, Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to other approved ABL1 inhibitors.

It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, despite its ability to initiate disease in mice, its status as an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response. Third generation ABL1 inhibitor ponatinib is the only FDA approved drug with activity against T315I . However due to risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels ponatinib is ONLY approved for T315I-positive CML or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL or in cases of CML, Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to other approved ABL1 inhibitors.

Patients with KIT exon 11 mutations were significantly more likely to have a partial response than those with KIT exon 9 mutations (P=.0006)  or double WT kinases (WT KIT and WT PDGFRA; P < .0001). The presence of a KIT exon 11 mutation was the strongest predictor of response (Hazard ratio= 7.85).

While successful in amplified EGFR, the efficacy of the first and second generation TKI's (erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) in treating patients harboring this mutation before treatment is notably lower. This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. A third generation TKI (osimertinib) has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC. Patients positive for T790M in a plasma-based test have similar outcomes like those with tumor biopsy testing.

In breast cancer PIK3CA mutations have been associated with better prognosis, and a greater survival outcome, however the PI3K pathway is also associated with increased drug resistance (trastuzumab/lapatinib). PIK3CA mutations in both HNSCC and CRC have been associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapeutic agents and mutations in exon 9 and 20 are associated with a poorer prognosis in CRC.

Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. The NCCN guidelines for colorectal cancer contain recommendations that the targeted therapies cetuximab and panitumumab should only be used in the context of wild type KRAS. However, cetuximab treatment was shown to extend survival in a single cohort of colorectal patients with G12D mutations.

Patients with a colorectal tumor bearing mutated K-ras did not benefit from cetuximab, whereas patients with a tumor bearing wild-type K-ras did benefit from cetuximab. The effectiveness of cetuximab was significantly associated with K-ras mutation status (P=0.01 for overall survival and P<0.001 for progression-free survival). In patients with wild-type K-ras tumors, treatment with cetuximab as compared with supportive care alone significantly improved overall survival.

Of 17 patients with BRAF V600E melanoma, 4 achieved partial response, 5 experienced stable disease lasting longer than 16 weeks, and 8 experienced disease progression (including 2 with prior vemurafenib treatment). One of the partial responders had a concomitant EGFR mutation, and two of the stable disease patients had other concomitant mutations (in RET or MET). The median days on treatment was 113 (18-366) for BRAF V600E melanoma patients and 107 (17-323) for BRAF V600 wildtype patients (n=23). Patients with BRAF V600E mutant melanoma experienced similar response rates (24% vs 20%) and rates of metabolic response measured by decrease in FDG uptake assessed by FDG-PET (86% vs 75%) compared to non-BRAF mutant patients. Patients with melanoma, either BRAF wt or V600E, experienced significant decreases in Ki67 expression by day 15 of MEK inhibitor treatment (P<0.02).

Of 18 patients with KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 10 experienced clinical benefit: 2 partial responses and 8 patients experiencing stable disease for longer than 8 weeks. The median days on treatment was 58.5 (13-394) with one patient ongoing treatment at the end of the study period (56 weeks).

Mutations at 3 AL residues (D835 [n = 31], D839 [n = 3], and Y842 [n = 16]), with varying degrees of resistance to ponatinib were identified. FLT3 D835 mutations were shown to confer resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AC220 and ponatinib.  This was especially found for D835Y and D835V mutations, whereas D835H mutations were found to confer moderate resistance to ponatinib but relatively minimal resistance to AC220.	23430109(PubMed)	PubMed		Smith et al., 2013, Blood		3.0	accepted	1036	437	24	13	28592642.0	28592642.0	C	A	ENST00000241453.7					75.0	GRCh37		Somatic	2016-02-21 22:23:23 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1036	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/437	https://civicdb.org/links/genes/24	False	True	False	False	False	False	False	1

378	ERBB2	2064	Y772_A775DUP	Lung Adenocarcinoma	3910.0		Afatinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	A 55 year old heavily pretreated patient with equivocal HER2 overexpression (IHC2+ and no amplification in FISH) was found to have the HER2 YMVA kinase domain insertion.  Afatinib monotherapy resulted in resolution of symptoms and 10 months before progressive disease.  The patient was subsequently given trastuzumab with no response.  The observed efficacy of afatinib against M774insAYVM, and studies reporting afatinib activity against other variants in the HER2 kinase domain, are cited by the authors as motivation for the arm of NCI-MATCH focusing on afatinib and activating HER2 mutations.	26559459(PubMed)	PubMed		Li et al., 2015, Lung Cancer		4.0	accepted	1045	414	20	17	37880996.0	37880997.0		TACGTGATGGCT	ENST00000269571.5					75.0	GRCh37	Mutations in the HER2 kinase domain occur at a 2-4% frequency in lung adenocarcinomas, the majority of which are in exon 20 as in-frame duplications or insertions in a small 8 codon region (774-781 or 775-782). These are analogous to the exon 20 alterations found in EGFR TK domain. The M774 insertion, M774insAYVM, represents 62.5% of all HER2 kinase domain mutations identified (when combined with the A775insYVMA mutations as they translate to the identical amino acid sequence changes). As demonstrated in mouse models (Perrera et al., PNAS 2009) and subsequent clinical trials in human lung adenocarcinoma with these insertions, HER2 YVMA mutants predict response to several targeted HER2 agonists such as afatinib, trastuzumab, neratinib and TDM-1 (trastuzumab emtansine) as monotherapy or combined with specific chemotherapies.

Induction of mutant HER2 in these mice drove rapid development of adenosquamous lung tumors, where tumor maintenance was dependent on continued YMVA HER2 induction by doxycycline.  Administration of afatinib had a stronger effect than erlotinib or trastuzumab, as measured by histology and tumor volume regression.  Authors state that in the case of afatinib vs. trastuzumab, intracellular HER2 signaling may be blocked by afatanib but remain unaltered by trastuzumab.	19122144(PubMed)	PubMed		Perera et al., 2009, Proc.

Subsequent treatment of this patient with Sym004 yielded disease stabilization lasting 15 weeks. In vitro analysis in colorectal cancer cell line NIH3T3 with EGFR mutations S492R, R451C, K467T, and G465R showed that antibody mixture Sym004 effectively bound to all mutants, whereas cetuximab and panitumumab did not effectively bind to all mutants. In-vitro, Sym004 inhibited growth of S492R and G465R EGFR mutant cell lines.

These are analogous to the exon 20 alterations found in EGFR TK domain. The M774 insertion, M774insAYVM, represents 62.5% of all HER2 kinase domain mutations identified (when combined with the A775insYVMA mutations as they translate to the identical amino acid sequence changes). As demonstrated in mouse models (Perrera et al., PNAS 2009) and subsequent clinical trials in human lung adenocarcinoma with these insertions, HER2 YVMA mutants predict response to several targeted HER2 agonists such as afatinib, trastuzumab, neratinib and TDM-1 (trastuzumab emtansine) as monotherapy or combined with specific chemotherapies.

Chemical inhibition of CDK1 by AZD5438 in KRAS mutant vs WT pancreatic and colorectal cancer cell lines showed increased efficacy in mutant cell lines. Finally, AZD5438 reduced tumor growth induced by SW620 (KRAS p.G12V) colorectal tumour cells xenografted into immunodeficient mice.	26881434(PubMed)	PubMed		Costa-Cabral et al., 2016, PLoS ONE		3.0	accepted	1183	336	30	12	25362365.0	25403737.0			ENST00000256078.4					75.0	GRCh37		Somatic	2016-07-25 16:58:42 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1183	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/336	https://civicdb.org/links/genes/30	False	False	False	False	False	False	True	1

453	ALK	238	EML4::ALK	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908.0		WHI-P154		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	A retroviral cDNA expression library was constructed using a lung adenocarcinoma specimen from a 67 year old NSCLC patient, and transfected into mouse 3T3 fibroblasts which were assessed for transformed foci.  Analysis of clones from one transformed focus yielded a novel fusion. This fusion generated a protein with N-terminal consisting of EML4 exons 1-13 and C-terminal consisting of ALK exons 20-29, which comprise the intracellular kinase domain of ALK. In subsequent experiments using EML4-ALK or altered versions, the transforming potential of EML4-ALK was found to be dependent on a functional ALK kinase activity as well as the EML4 basic domain, which was shown to have an important role in EML4-ALK dimer formation.  BA/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK were able to grow independently of IL3 addition, but addition of ALK inhibitor WHI-P154 induced cell death and inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of EML4-ALK. These results indicated that EML4-ALK may be a driver mutation in NSCLC,  and a target for ALK inhibitor treatment.	17625570(PubMed)	PubMed		Soda et al., 2007, Nature		5.0	accepted	1188	5	1	2	42396490.0	42522656.0			ENST00000318522.5	2	29415640.0	29446394.0	ENST00000389048.3	75.0	GRCh37	The EML4-ALK fusion variant 1 consisting of ALK kinase domain (exons 20-29) fused to EML4 exons 1-13 is the most common EML4-ALK variant, and was discovered in non-small cell lung cancer.

Median PFS among patients randomized to chemotherapy was 7 weeks (95% CI, 4.3-8.4 weeks; median treatment duration, 8 weeks; interquartile range [IQR], 4.3-16 weeks) vs. 15.9 weeks with selumetinib (95% CI, 8.4-21.1 weeks; median treatment duration, 16.1 weeks; IQR, 8.1-25.3 weeks) (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.30-0.71; P < 0.001). Most patients (80/96 evaluable harbored a mutation in exon 5 of GNAQ or GNA11) but PFS benefit from Selumetinib compared to chemotherapy was greater in the GNAQ and GNA11 wild-type population (25.9 weeks [range, 3.7-40.4 weeks] vs 15.4 weeks [range, 8.1-16.9 weeks]). However, PFS was still better with Selumetinib than chemotherapy in the GNA mutant population (hazard ratio 0.55, 95% CI, 0.34-0.87; P = 0.01). The difference was explained by potential GNAQ or GNA11 mutations outside of exon 5 in the GNA wild-type population.

A FGFR1 N546K mutation was detected in one patient. Gain of the FGFR1 locus (qPCR) was observed in 13 of 41 patients (31.7%) and Ewing sarcoma cell lines (A673, CADO, SK-NMC, SK-ES, and VH-64). FGFR1 was also highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma (mRNA and IHC) and correlated with copy number. Retroviral transduction of FGFR1 wild-type or the FGFR1 N546K mutant into NIH3T3 cells led to enhanced proliferation especially for cells harboring the FGFR1 mutation. ShRNA mediated knockdown of FGFR1 inhibited growth of Ewing sarcoma and other cancer cells (A549 lung carcinoma cell line or leukemia cell lines HL60 and Kasumi) with almost complete growth suppression only in the Ewing sarcoma cell lines and knockdown of FGFR1 abrogated growth of cell lines in xenograft.

SNP analysis of patient bone marrow mononuclear cells and LM1 showed chromosomal changes associated with the cell line but 94.7% of SNPs were identically called.  ALK kinase inhibitor TAE684 induced cell death in LM1 cells at low nanomolar concentrations, while it did not significantly effect the ALK-rearrangement negative DLBCL cell line Karpas422.  LM1 cells formed tumors in 3/10 SCID and 9/10 NOD-SCID mice.  CD30 and CD138 immmunostaining were maintained between original tumor and LM1 xenografts. In mice, LM1 but not Karpas422 xenografts regressed with TAE684 administration, and complete remission for 13 weeks was observed before experiment was terminated.	21494621(PubMed)	PubMed		Cerchietti et al., 2011, PLoS ONE		4.0	accepted	1261	520	1	17	57697219.0	57768072.0			ENST00000269122.3	2	29415640.0	29446394.0	ENST00000389048.3	75.0	GRCh37	The t(2;17)(p23;q23) translocation results in the CLTC-ALK fusion protein, the most common ALK fusion observed in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

Histopathological analysis showed diffuse tumor cell infiltrate (CD20/EMA negative) with cytoplasmic ALK. RT-PCR indicated CLTC-ALK fusion. The patient was diagnosed with splenic ALK + diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Stage III, Group A with an IPI of 3. CHOP-21 chemotherapy regimen was administered with improvement in abdominal lymph nodes but worsening in retroperitoneal lymph nodes assessed via standardized uptake values. Subsequent ICE chemotherapy regiment relieved some symptoms prompting the patient to refuse further treatment despite other indications of disease progression. Therapy was reinstated after worsening of disease. GEMOX chemotherapy was administered with dexamethasone and 250mg crizotinib twice daily resulting in symptom relief, decreased lymphadenopathy and LDH decline. The disease then progressed and the patient died 2 months after crizotinib initiation.

Preclinical work indicates that CLTC-ALK DLBCL is responsive to ALK inhibition in cell lines and mouse models, and two case studies show short response followed by progression when heavily pretreated and advanced ALK-positive DLBCL is treated with crizotinib (one case CLTC-ALK, one case an unknown ALK fusion).

In breast cancer PIK3CA mutations have been associated with better prognosis, and a greater survival outcome, however the PI3K pathway is also associated with increased drug resistance (trastuzumab/lapatinib). PIK3CA mutations in both HNSCC and CRC have been associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapeutic agents and mutations in exon 9 and 20 are associated with a poorer prognosis in CRC.

Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. The NCCN guidelines for colorectal cancer contain recommendations that the targeted therapies cetuximab and panitumumab should only be used in the context of wild type KRAS. However, cetuximab treatment was shown to extend survival in a single cohort of colorectal patients with G12D mutations.

Shorter survival has been indicated in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, however, larger cohorts are required to verify this finding.

While successful in amplified EGFR, the efficacy of the first and second generation TKI's (erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) in treating patients harboring this mutation before treatment is notably lower. This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. A third generation TKI (osimertinib) has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC. Patients positive for T790M in a plasma-based test have similar outcomes like those with tumor biopsy testing.

It is one of the most widely studied variants in cancer. This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.

Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. The NCCN guidelines for colorectal cancer contain recommendations that the targeted therapies cetuximab and panitumumab should only be used in the context of wild type KRAS. However, cetuximab treatment was shown to extend survival in a single cohort of colorectal patients with G12D mutations. Overall, the interpretation for KRAS mutations in most clinical scenarios is still undecided.

Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G12 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. However, results are conflicting with retrospective analyses suggesting a better response to EGFR-Inhibition.

Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. MDA-MB-361 is a HER2 amplified breast cancer cell line harboring PIK3CA E545K, and it had an IC50 of 0.14uM. To asses the effect of pictilisib on cell cycle progression and apoptosis, fluorescence based cell cycle and flow cytometry were used to measure the proportion of cells in various phases and the relative presence of Annexin V, a marker of apoptosis. Untreated, 68% of cells were in G1 or sub-G1. Following treatment with 1.0uM pictilisib, the proportion of cells in G1 or sub-G1 rose to 78%, and the amount of Annexin V detected rose 3 fold. A substantial reduction in phosphorylated AKT (S473) was also noted. Authors concluded that pictilisib had a modest effect on cell cycle progression and encouraged apoptosis in this cell line, and that this cell line is sensitive to pictilisib. Authors further noted that HER2 amplified cell lines were generally more sensitive, regardless of mutation, to pictilisib than basal-like breast cancer cell lines (p=0.002).	20453058(PubMed)	PubMed		O'Brien et al., 2010, Clin.

898	EGFR	1956	T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908.0		Afatinib		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	In an in vitro study using purified EGFR protein, kinase activity was assayed and compared for wildtype EGFR, EGFR-T790M and EGFR-T790M/L858R using both reversible and irreversible TKI drugs. EFGR proteins with T790M or T790M/L858R mutations were more sensitive to afatinib treatment (IC50: 9.8nM and 24nM, respectively vs. IC50: >1000nM and >1000nM, respectively) compared to treatment with erlotinib or lapatinib treatment. In an in vitro study using NCI-H358 cells (wildtype EGFR) and NCI-H1975 cells (EGFR-L858R/T790M), inhibition of cell growth was used as an assay to determine sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs. Cells with an EGFR L858R/T790M mutation demonstrated an improved response to afatinib (GI50: 42.0nM vs. >1000nM) compared to the same cells treated with erlotinib. However, IC50s were intermediate compared to a more potent pan-HER inhibitor.	21732342(PubMed)	PubMed		Cha et al., 2012, Int. J.

Of those, 76 patients harbored KRAS G12D, were BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA wt, and had individual response data. Five patients had partial response, 34 had stable disease, and 37 progressed. Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=61), cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=6), cetuximab monotherapy (n=5), cetuximab + oxaliplatin + 5FU (n=2), cetuximab + 5FU (n=1), cetuximab + oxaliplatin + bevacizumab (n=1). Median PFS was 12 weeks (3-169 weeks), median OS was 31 weeks (6-232 weeks), and median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 2 (0-5). Median age was 62 years old (32-86), and there were 43 males and 33 females. Using these data and data from the larger cohort, authors concluded that KRAS mutation was strongly associated with poor response to cetuximab and suggested that mutation status of KRAS is the most informative compared to BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 for predicting cetuximab response.	20619739(PubMed)	PubMed		De Roock et al., 2010, Lancet Oncol.		3.0	accepted	2207	79	30	12	25398284.0	25398284.0	C	T	ENST00000256078.4					75.0	GRCh37	While the KRAS G12 region is a widely studied recurrent region in cancer, its impact on clinical action is still actively debated. Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. The NCCN guidelines for colorectal cancer contain recommendations that the targeted therapies cetuximab and panitumumab should only be used in the context of wild type KRAS.

All four patients' GISTs harbored PDGFRA exon 18 mutatations (one I843_S847delinsM, three D842_H845del). The overall survival was more than 12 months for all four of these patients (mean 40.8 months), which is comparable to patients with WT PDGFRA (49.0months).	18955451(PubMed)	PubMed		Heinrich et al., 2008, J.

1001	PDGFRA	5156	MUTATION	Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor	9253.0		Imatinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	This prospective study of 127 patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) examined the relationship between kinase (KIT and PDGFRA) genotype and treatment outcome for patients enrolled in a randomized phase II trial of imatinib (CSTI571B 2222). Six GISTs harbored PDGFRA mutations, three of which were deemed imatinib-sensitive by the authors: 1 DIMH842-845 deletion, one I843 deletion, and one V561D point mutation. Two of these patients' GISTs experienced partial responses to imatinib and one experienced progressive disease. Overall, the partial response rate of patients with an imatinib sensitive mutation of KIT or PDGFRA was 75.7% (87 of 115 patients), whereas the partial response rate in patients with no kinase mutation or a previously described imatinib resistant mutation was 0% (0 of 12 patients). The authors concluded that PDGFRA gain-of-function mutations may account for imatinib sensivity in some WT KIT GISTs.	14645423(PubMed)	PubMed		Heinrich et al., 2003, J. Clin.

Best described in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the mutation seems to confer sensitivity to first and second generation TKI's like gefitinib and neratinib. NSCLC patients with this mutation treated with TKI's show increased overall and progression-free survival, as compared to chemotherapy alone. Third generation TKI's are currently in clinical trials that specifically focus on mutant forms of EGFR, a few of which have shown efficacy in treating patients that failed to respond to earlier generation TKI therapies.

Conversely, when treated with trastuzumab, the cell line harboring PIK3CA K111N experienced a smaller reduction in cell viability. Further, treatment with T-DM1 on SCID mice xenografted with PIK3CA K111N cells resulted in inhibition of tumor growth.

Out of 40 BRCA (BRCA1 or BRCA2) mutant patients, 5 had somatic BRCA2 mutation, 4 of which were homozygous mutations and one had unknown zygosity. Confirmed objective response was seen in 80% (4/5) of the somatic BRCA2 mutant subgroup. Authors note that response rate was similar regardless of whether the BRCA mutation was somatic or germline, in BRCA 1 or BRCA 2. In a BRCA wild-type subgroup, with low levels of loss of heterozygosity (LOH), confirmed objective response was observed in 10% (7/70) of the patients. Patients with BRCA mutant tumors experienced significantly longer median progression free survival than patients with BRCA wildtype, LOH low tumors (12.8 vs 5.2 mo, HR: 0.27, P<0.0001).	27908594(PubMed)	PubMed		Swisher et al., 2017, Lancet Oncol.

It is one of the most widely studied variants in cancer. This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.

In an exploratory biomarker analysis, imbalance of the AKT1 E17K-mutant allele, most frequently caused by copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity targeting the wild-type allele, was associated with longer PFS as was the presence of coincident PI3K pathway hotspot mutations. Persistent declines in AKT1 E17K in cfDNA were associated with improved PFS and response. Responses were not restricted to patients with detectable AKT1 E17K in pretreatment cfDNA.	28489509(PubMed)	PubMed		Hyman et al., 2017, J. Clin.

This mass progressed under treatment at which point PCR amplification of BRAF exon 15 and subsequent Sanger sequencing the initial biopsy revealed the tumor harbored a BRAF V600E mutation. Based on these results, vemurafenib monotherapy was started and radiological and clinical response was noted after 3 months of treatment, which was sustained after 6 months of therapy. Prior to vemurafenib treatment, the patient had undergone tracheotomy, was treated with standard chemotherapy and underwent another surgery, but had developed progressive disease.	25524464(PubMed)	PubMed		del Bufalo et al., 2014, J Transl Med		3.0	accepted	3777	12	5	7	140453136.0	140453136.0	A	T	ENST00000288602.6					75.0	GRCh37	BRAF V600E has been shown to be recurrent in many cancer types.

Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort.

Of those, 50 patients harbored KRAS G13D, were BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA wt, and had individual response data. Nine patients had partial response, 19 had stable disease, and 22 progressed. Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=38), cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=5), cetuximab monotherapy (n=4), cetuximab + oxaliplatin + 5FU (n=2), and cetuximab + irinotecan + oxaliplatin + 5FU (n=1). Median PFS was 16 weeks (3-101 weeks), median OS was 33 weeks (3-161 weeks), and median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 2 (0-4). Median age was 65 years old (34-78), and there were 29 males and 20 females. Authors concluded that KRAS mutation was strongly associated with poor response to cetuximab and suggested that mutation status of KRAS is the most informative compared to BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 for predicting cetuximab response.	20619739(PubMed)	PubMed		De Roock et al., 2010, Lancet Oncol.		3.0	accepted	3881	81	30	12	25398281.0	25398281.0	C	T	ENST00000256078.4					75.0	GRCh37	While the KRAS G13 region is a widely studied recurrent region in cancer, its impact on clinical action is still debated.

Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=13), cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=1), cetuximab+5FU (n=1), cetuximab + irinotecan + oxaliplatin + bevacizumab (n=1). Median PFS was 12 weeks (2-50 weeks), median OS was 25 weeks (10-135 weeks), and median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 2 (1-6). Median age was 59 years old (31-69), and there were 9 males and 7 females.

Increased p-Akt stain was seen with ectopic mutant EGFR over wildtype cells. Parallel erlotinib incubations of cells with wildtype EGFR induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien only at high concentration (10uM). Addition of erlotinib to mutant EGFR cell incubations reduced p-Akt signal and induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien at considerably lower conecntration (100 nM) erlotinib.  These results indicate the EGFR L858R variant as a growth pathway driver targetable by erlotinib.	17877814(PubMed)	PubMed		de Gunst et al., 2007, Mol.

This patient was a 27 year old female with one pack year who experienced partial response on crizotinib as 4th line therapy. The patient's pre-crizotinib biopsy was ALK+ and lacked the EGFR mutation. A biopsy taken after 63 days on crizotinib showed EGFR L858R mutation and lacked ALK gene rearrangement by FISH (ALK Loss). Of note, a second post-treatment biopsy (after 113 on crizotinib) showed ALK rearrangement but lacked EGFR mutation. The authors interpreted the emergence of an ALK negative tumor (first post-critozitinib biopsy) as evidence of a separate oncogenic driver (EGFR L858R).	22235099(PubMed)	PubMed		Doebele et al., 2012, Clin.

It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, despite its ability to initiate disease in mice, its status as an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response. Third generation ABL1 inhibitor ponatinib is the only FDA approved drug with activity against T315I . However due to risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels ponatinib is ONLY approved for T315I-positive CML or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL or in cases of CML, Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to other approved ABL1 inhibitors.

The cells were tested for Regorafenib resistance. Ba/F3 cells with del 557-558/T670I mutations (IC50 = 132 +- 25 nM) did show resistance towards  Regorafenib  compared to Ba/F3 cells with del 557-558 alone (IC50 = 30 +- 14 nM). In addition, Ba/F3 cells were mutagenized with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea and incubated with varying concentrations of Regorafenib. In Regorafenib incubated cells, T670I mutations were seen in approximately 10% of the resistant cell populations. The results suggest that T670I does induce regorafenib resistance in del 557-558/T670I cells.	25239608(PubMed)	PubMed		Garner et al., 2014, Clin.

It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, despite its ability to initiate disease in mice, its status as an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response. Third generation ABL1 inhibitor ponatinib is the only FDA approved drug with activity against T315I . However due to risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels ponatinib is ONLY approved for T315I-positive CML or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL or in cases of CML, Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to other approved ABL1 inhibitors.

Cell lines harboring this mutant is also more responsive to treatment with doxorubicin than its wild-type counterparts. While the prognostic impact of individual TP53 mutations is influenced by the cohort being studied, it has been shown that the R175H mutation is correlated with worse overall survival than wild-type TP53, but is not as detrimental as the R248W variant.

This is most well characterized in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but other cell lines containing these mutations have been shown to be resistant as well. Exogenous expression of the A842V mutation resulted in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRA in the absence of ligand in 293T cells and cytokine-independent proliferation of the IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cell line, both evidence that this is an activating mutation.

In myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IDH1 R132 mutations have been shown to be associated with worse outcome and shorter overall survival. They have also been linked to cytogenetically normal AML, an intermediate risk subtype of the disease. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1. Also in contrast to AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated with the specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.

After disease progression to erlotinib, a repeat liver biopsy revealed an EGFR T790M mutation. He began treatment with osimertinib at 80mg daily. After 8 weeks of this treatment CT imaging revealed unequivocal disease progression.	28874593(PubMed)	PubMed		Cecchini et al., 2017, J Natl Compr Canc Netw		2.0	accepted	6006	34	19	7	55249071.0	55249071.0	C	T	ENST00000275493.2					75.0	GRCh37	EGFR T790M was one of the very first mutations recognized to confer resistance to targeted therapies in non-small cell lung cancer. While successful in amplified EGFR, the efficacy of the first and second generation TKI's (erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) in treating patients harboring this mutation before treatment is notably lower. This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. A third generation TKI (osimertinib) has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC. Patients positive for T790M in a plasma-based test have similar outcomes like those with tumor biopsy testing.

Osimertinib failed to induce substantial reductions in phosphorylated ERBB2 in NR6 mouse fibroblast cells transduced to co-express ERBB2 L869R and T798I or ERBB2 wt. AZ5104 blocked phosphorylation to a greater extent in the mutant and wildtype cells. MCF10A cells transduced with ERBB2 wt, ERBB2 T798I alone or ERBB2 L869R and T798I co-expressed did not show substantial reductions in phosphorylated ERBB2, AKT, ERK or S6. AZ5104 induced greater reductions. Authors note that AZ5104 is not being developed independently of osimertinib and only 10% of osimertinib is metabolized into AZ5104 in humans.

Third generation TKI's are currently in clinical trials that specifically focus on mutant forms of EGFR, a few of which have shown efficacy in treating patients that failed to respond to earlier generation TKI therapies.

1507	EGFR	1956	EXON 19 DELETION	Lung Adenocarcinoma	3910.0		Gefitinib		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	A Japanese Phase III clinical study assessed the noninferiority of gefitinib in comparison to erlotinib in 561 patients with postoperative or recurrent stage IIIB/IV lung adenocarcinoma. Patients were pretreated with at least one chemotherapy regimen, but no tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In the subgroup of 156 patients with exon 19 deletions as their sole EGFR mutation, 83 and 78 were treated with erlotinib and gefitinib, respectively. Objective response (defined as complete + partial response) was approximately 65 percent for both erlotinib gefitinib and non significantly different  (p= .965). Disease control rate (defined as complete response + partial response + stable disease) was 91.6 and 83.3 percent for erlotinib and gefitinib, respectively (p=.113). The study was unable to demonstrate statistical noninferiority via the planned end point; however, the lack of statistically significant differences between erlotinib and gefitinib responses, and the milder adverse effects experienced by gefitinib treated patients, led the authors to conclude that gefitinib is a feasible alternative to erlotinib in treating patients with ex19del EGFR positive, advanced lung adenocarcinoma.	27022112(PubMed)	PubMed		Urata et al., 2016, J.

Growth of untransduced BT-474 control cells was prevented by treatment with any monotherapy or combination of trastuzumab, lapatinib, or dactolisib.	19010894(PubMed)	PubMed		Eichhorn et al., 2008, Cancer Res.		3.0	accepted	6213	104	37	3	178936091.0	178936091.0	G	A	ENST00000263967.3					75.0	GRCh37	PIK3CA E545K/E542K are the second most recurrent PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer, and are highly recurrent mutations in many other cancer types. E545K, and possibly the other mutations in the E545 region, may present patients with a poorer prognosis than patients with either patients with other PIK3CA variant or wild-type PIK3CA. There is also data to suggest that E545/542 mutations may confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors like cetuximab. While very prevalent, targeted therapies for variants in PIK3CA are still in early clinical trial phases.

1520	AKT1	207	Q79K	Melanoma	1909.0		Dabrafenib		Predictive	Supports	C	Resistance	In a retrospective study of 44 relapsed melanoma patients with BRAF V600E/K (known BRAF inhibitor sensitizing mutations), AKT1 Q79K was associated with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor (dabrafenib) monotherapy in one patient. This patient was a 38 year old female with stage IV M1a melanoma who took dabrafenib (35 mg twice daily to 100 mg three times a day). The best overall response was a 100% reduction in the sum of target lesions, and progression free survival lasted 119 days. Prior to dabrafenib monotherapy, this patient's baseline tumor harbored BRAF V600K—no other somatic alterations were noted. Following relapse, the patient gained AKT1 Q79K in one of two disease progressive tumors. Whole exome sequencing and Sanger re-sequencing were used for all tumors. The authors hypothesized that disruptions in the PI3K-PTEN-AKT pathway represent a core mechanism of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy.	24265155(PubMed)	PubMed		Shi et al., 2014, Cancer Discov		4.0	accepted	6260	169	2	14	105243048.0	105243048.0	G	T	ENST00000407796.2					75.0	GRCh37		Somatic	2018-07-19 20:04:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6260	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/169	https://civicdb.org/links/genes/2	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	1

Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. However, cetuximab treatment was shown to extend survival in a cohort of colorectal patients.

1564	PIK3CA	5290	MUTATION	Colorectal Cancer	9256.0		Aspirin		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	This was a retrospective study of 964 colorectal cancer patients who participated in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Of 964 patients, 803 patients had wildtype PIK3CA (aspirin use: 337/803, no aspirin use: 466/803)  and 161 had mutated PIK3CA (aspirin use: 66/161, no aspirin use: 95/161). This study found that—among patients with mutated PIK3CA cancer— regular use of aspirin following diagnosis was correlated with superior colorectal cancer specific survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.06-0.61; P<0.001) and overall survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31-0.94; P = 0.01). Conversely, among patients with wild-type PIK3CA, regular use of aspirin after diagnosis was not significantly associated with colorectal cancer–specific survival or overall survival. Among patients with mutated-PIK3CA tumors, 23 of 90 patients who did not use aspirin after diagnosis (26%) died within 5 years after diagnosis, whereas only 2 of 62 regular users of aspirin after diagnosis (3%) died within 5 years after diagnosis (P<0.001). In contrast, among patients with wild-type PIK3CA tumors, the 5-year cumulative colorectal cancer–specific mortality was the same (15%) for users and nonusers of aspirin after diagnosis (P = 0.92). The authors conclude that PIK3CA mutation may predict response to aspirin therapy in patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer.	23094721(PubMed)	PubMed		Liao et al., 2012, N. Engl. J.

These mutations have been observed in up to 40%, 20%, and 21% respectively for each of these cancer types with mutations commonly occurring within the helical exon 9 and kinase domain of exon 20. In breast cancer PIK3CA mutations have been associated with better prognosis, and a greater survival outcome, however the PI3K pathway is also associated with increased drug resistance (trastuzumab/lapatinib). PIK3CA mutations in both HNSCC and CRC have been associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapeutic agents and mutations in exon 9 and 20 are associated with a poorer prognosis in CRC. Interestingly PIK3CA mutations in HNSCC have been observed to be absent from a number of ethnic groups including greek, german, and vietnamese populations.

This line showed a significant reduction in colony formation (P = 0.0004) and MTT assay, which tests for NADH activity (P < 0.001), with imatinib vs vehicle treatment. There was no significant difference in a lung cancer cell line without a known driver (H2126) nor in an immortalized bronchial epithelial line (Beas-2B) with either drug treatment in colony forming and MTT assays. Additionally, reduction in cell viability upon kinase inhibitor treatment was rescued with tetracycline-induced overexpression of resistant ABL1-T315I (P < 0.001) confirming the genetic dependency of this cell line on ABL1. Moreover, siRNA facilitated depletion of ABL1 expression resulted in significantly increased cytotoxicity (P < 0.004) with no significant change in H2126 or Beas-2B lines for 2/3 siRNAs supporting ABL1 as the primary drug target. Significant tumor reduction was observed in murine NSCLC xenografts of the H1915 cell line treated with imatinib compared to vehicle treatment (P = 0.0016). No change in tumor growth was observed in xenografts of the H650 cell line containing a wildtype ABL1 locus. In both in vitro and in vivo experiments, doxycycline-inducible expression of drug-resistant ABL1-T315I rescued imatinib-mediated inhibitory effects supporting the specificity of drug responses.	26758680(PubMed)	PubMed		Testoni et al., 2016, EMBO Mol Med		5.0	accepted	6376	1656	4	9	133748333.0	133748333.0	C	T	ENST00000372348.2					75.0	GRCh37		Somatic	2018-11-05 23:10:28 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6376	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/1656	https://civicdb.org/links/genes/4	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	1

Patients whose GISTs harbored KIT exon 11 mutations (n=19) experienced higher rates of clinical benefit (defined as complete response, partial response, or stable disease lasting >16 weeks) than patients whose GISTs harbored KIT exon 9 mutations.  15/19 patients with exon 11 mutant GISTs experienced clinical benefit (including 2 PRs). KIT exon 11 mutant GISTs treated with regorafenib monotherapy were associated with improved median progression free survival (13.4 months vs. 5.7 and 1.6 months, P<0.0001), as compared to patients with KIT exon 9 mutation (n=2) and patients with KIT wildtype, non-succinate dehydrogenase-deficient tumors (n=2).	27371698(PubMed)	PubMed		Ben-Ami et al., 2016, Ann.

The majority of patients (70.1%) had received two or more prior antineoplastic therapies. An overall response rate of 25.4% was observed and an additional 38.8% of patients had disease stabilization. No clear differences between type of FGFR3 aberration and response could be seen. Four of five patients with FGFR3-TACC3 fusions had response data, with three achieving stable disease and one having a complete response. The authors conclude that BGJ398 appears to have moderate anticancer activity in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma, that response rates and disease control rate exceed outcomes with most agents in this setting, and that enriching for patients with activating FGFR3 mutations together with the high specificity of BGJ398 for FGFR3 likely explains this improved response.	29848605(PubMed)	PubMed		Pal et al., 2018, Cancer Discov		3.0	accepted	6409	830	23	4	1795039.0	1808661.0			ENST00000340107.4	4	1741429.0	1746898.0	ENST00000313288.4	75.0	GRCh37		Somatic	2021-05-05 05:52:18 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6409	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/830	https://civicdb.org/links/genes/23	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	1

In myelodysplastic syndromes, IDH1 R132 mutations have been shown to be associated with worse outcome and shorter overall survival. They have also been linked to cytogenetically normal AML, an intermediate risk subtype of the disease.

The patient was diagnosed with IFS at 6 months of age. At 16 months the patient enrolled in a pediatric Phase 1 trial of LOXO‐101 (Larotrectinib, ARRY-470), an experimental, highly selective inhibitor of TRK. The patient experienced a rapid, radiographic response, demonstrating the potential for LOXO‐101 to provide benefit for IFS harboring NTRK gene fusions.	27093299(PubMed)	PubMed		Nagasubramanian et al., 2016, Pediatr Blood Cancer		2.0	accepted	6473	801	3985	12	11802788.0	12022903.0			ENST00000396373.4	15	88483984.0	88418230.0	ENST00000394480.2	75.0	GRCh37		Somatic	2020-06-12 15:55:10 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6473	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/801	https://civicdb.org/links/genes/3985	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	1

Over the next years, she experienced recurrence, multiple rounds of chemotherapy and metastasis -- until her case was presented at a virtual multidisciplinary tumor board organized by the Global Cancer Institute which recommended testing for ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. This fusion was confirmed by RNA-seq, targeted DNA and WGS sequencing as well as immunohistochemistry staining with a TRK antibody. The patient was treated with LOXO-101 (larotrectinib) in a single patient use protocol. Within two months, she experienced near complete resolution of a 10.4 × 8.5 cm fungating chest mass with multiple satellite lesions (See Figure 2). The authors note that TERT promoter mutation and a reciprocal inversion including CDKN2A were also identified, but given what is known about LOXO-101 and ETV6-NTRK3, they  infer ETV6-NTRK3 fusion as the primary mitogenic driver in this patient.	29623306(PubMed)	PubMed		Shukla et al., 2017, JCO Precis Oncol		3.0	accepted	6475	801	3985	12	11802788.0	12022903.0			ENST00000396373.4	15	88483984.0	88418230.0	ENST00000394480.2	75.0	GRCh37		Somatic	2018-08-21 15:25:38 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6475	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/801	https://civicdb.org/links/genes/3985	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	1

In YFP-luciferase PDX mice from a 16-year-old with Ph-like B-ALL, flow cytometry indicated the absence of leukemic cells in the bone marrow (p<.0001), peripheral blood (p=.0018), and spleen (p=.0001) after 6 weeks of Larotrectinib (n=10) compared to vehicle treated mice (n=10). Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib. After 48 hours of Larotrectinib exposure, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing ETV6-NTRK3 demonstrated a response with an IC50 of 17.0nM (viability measured by CellTiter blue). Finally, Larotrectinib was 1000x more potent against 3 human cancer cell lines with an NTRK fusion versus the 76 with other alterations. The most sensitive was an AML cell line (M0-91) with an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion.	29880614(PubMed)	PubMed		Roberts et al., 2018, Blood		4.0	accepted	6930	801	3985	12	11802788.0	12022903.0			ENST00000396373.4	15	88483984.0	88418230.0	ENST00000394480.2	75.0	GRCh37		Somatic	2021-07-24 02:21:27 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6930	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/801	https://civicdb.org/links/genes/3985	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	1

The patient had a complex karyotype and microarray revealed a 9p duplication involving JAK2 and deletions of IKZF1, PAX5, and CDKN2A. RNA studies demonstrated a Ph-like ALL expression signature but did not identify the underlying kinase fusion. Research level RNA sequencing identified a GOLGA5-JAK2 fusion which was confirmed by other methods and patient cells were introduced to patient-derived xenograft models that demonstrated a response to ruxolitinib. Therefore, 40mg/m2 ruxolitinib was added to the patient’s multiagent chemotherapy regiment. The treatment was well tolerated and the patient demonstrated significant clinical response by the end of consolidation, though MRD ≥ 0.01% was detected by flow cytometry. The patient received CART therapy and achieved MRD negative remission, then underwent HSCT, and remained in remission with full donor chimerism at 2-months post-HSCT.	29773603(PubMed)	PubMed		Ding et al., 2018, Haematologica		3.0	accepted	7007	3214	28													The GOLGA5-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the GOLGA5 (Golgin A5) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 10 of GOLGA5 to exon 12 of JAK2 (GOLGA5-JAK2 10-12). The fusion is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(9;14)(p24;q32), and has been identified in one patient by RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the coiled coil domain from GOLGA5 and an aberrantly activated JH1 kinase domain from JAK2, which is thought to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The inclusion of the JH1 domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The novel GOLGA5-JAK2 fusion has been documented in one 10-year-old boy with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia with complex karyotype. The clinical details of this case could predict response to treatment with JAK2 inhibitors. A xenograft model created from the patient's malignant cells demonstrated clearance of the leukemic clone in murine peripheral blood upon exposure to ruxolitinib. Moreover, this drug was added to the child's treatment regimen, resulting in nearly undetectable levels of the GOLGA5-JAK2 fusion measured after 64 days of therapy. The patient has reportedly remained in remission 20 months after CAR T-cell infusion and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This child was included in the currently ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of JAK2 inhibitors in treating pediatric B-lymphoblastic leukemia with JAK2 fusions (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723994).

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 34 of NUP214 to exon 2 of ABL1 (NUP214-ABL1 34-2). In T-ALL, the fusion is typically expressed from amplified extrachromosomal bodies (episomes) that arise when the genomic region from ABL1 to NUP214 circularizes to generate the NUP214-ABL1 fusion. In B-ALL, the fusion commonly results from an intrachromosomal duplication involving chromosome 9, with breakpoints within the NUP214 and ABL1 genes. The fusion has been identified in 6% of cases of T-lymphoblastic leukemia and rare cases of B-lymphoblastic leukemia by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, single nucleotide polymorphism array, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and fluorescence in situ hybridization targeting the ABL1 gene. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the WD40 repeat and coiled-coil domains of NUP214 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and MAPK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways.

1622	ABL1	25	SNX2::ABL1	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	80630.0	Young adult onset	Imatinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Reduced Sensitivity	In a 29-year-old man with pre B-cell ALL, the t(5;9)(q23;q34) [SNX2-ABL1] was identified. The SNX2-ABL1 fusion, which joins the N-terminal domain of SNX2 without the PX domain to ABL1 exon 4, was detected by RACE PCR and confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. The patient responded to initial chemotherapy, but relapsed early. He then demonstrated a response to hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-C-VAD), but relapsed again. The patient next received imatinib and supportive measures, including hydroxycarbamide, but unfortunately succumbed to his disease approximately one year after diagnosis.	21391972(PubMed)	PubMed		Ernst et al., 2011, Br.

Haematol.		1.0	accepted	7254	2678	4	5	122110691.0	122135550.0			ENST00000379516.2	9	133738150.0	133763062.0	ENST00000372348.2	75.0	GRCh37	The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SNX2 (Sorting Nexin 2) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 3 of SNX2 to exon 4 of ABL1 (SNX2-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(5;9)(p23.2;q34.12) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the sorting nexin, N-terminal domain of SNX2 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in six young men between the ages of 7 and 29 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens that, while producing initially encouraging results, ultimately did not prevent these individuals from succumbing to their disease. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).

1639	ABL1	25	FOXP1::ABL1	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	80630.0	Young adult onset	Dasatinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	A 16-year-old Caucasian boy was diagnosed with B-ALL. Karyotype showed an abnormal clone characterized by the t(3;9)(p13;q34.1). This translocation results in an abnormal fusion between the FOXP1 gene in 3p13 and the ABL1 in 9q34.1. The FOXP1-ABL1 fusion is known to be associated with Ph-like B-ALL subtype of B-ALL. The patient was treated with Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) high-risk 4-drug induction chemotherapy with prednisone, daunorubicin, vincristine, and pegasparaginase and had 0.013% MRD at the end of indusciton. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib was added to the consolidationchemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, peg-asparaginase, mercaptopurine, and vincristine. End-of-consolidation bone marrow tested negative for MRD. The patient was continued on standard high-risk BFM therapy, plus dasatinib.	30938769(PubMed)	PubMed		Yenamandra et al., 2019, Lab Med		1.0	accepted	7292	2682	4													The FOXP1-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the FOXP1 (Forkhead box P1) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 27 of FOXP1to exon 4 of ABL1 (FOXP1-ABL1). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(3;9)(p12;q34) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and NGS. FOXP1 is critical for the transcriptional regulatory network of B lymphopoiesis; it may also act as a tumor suppressor gene. Absence or deficiency of FOXP1 during early B-cell development may block pro-B cell to pre-B cell development. The FOXP1-ABL1 fusion protein leads to activated tyrosine kinase and may further alter the critical cellular function of these 2 genes. Clinical significance: The FOXP1-ABL1 fusion has been documented in 3 young adult patients (2 male, 1 female) with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. One patient had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib) added to the chemotherapy regimens, who had bone marrow tested negative for MRD at end of consolidation. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Functional studies are needed to substantiate the efficacy of TKI treatment of this particular ABL-class fusion.

Primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS), and median PFS according to masked independent review was 14.7 months (95% CI 11.1–16.6) with dacomitinib group 9.2 months (9.1–11.0) with gefitinib (HR 0·59, 95% CI 0·47–0·74; p<0·0001).  Benefit of dacomitinib over gefitinib was lower in non-Asian patient subgroup (n=106) than in Asian group (n=346) although authors note smaller sample size may explain this. Authors state that PFS was significantly improved with first line dacomitinib treatment, and that dacomitinib should be considered for EGFR mutant NSCLC treatment.	28958502(PubMed)	PubMed		Wu et al., 2017, Lancet Oncol.

Using a series of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, lorlatinib was the most effective inhibitor of cytokine-independent growth. The glioblastoma cell line U118MG was shown to have the GOPC–ROS1 fusion. Lorlatinib and other TKIs were unable to inhibit growth of U118MG in standard growth assays (2D). However, lorlatinib did induce cell death in both ultra-low attachment dishes and spheroid assays, and significantly increased overall survival in an orthotopic intracranial xenograft model using this cell line (N=4) compared to mice on vehicle alone (N=4, p<0.001, ANOVA).

However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.

FISH and nested PCR revealed the patient had a t(4;22)(q12;11) translocation that created an in-frame BCR-PDGFRA fusion. The constitutively activating coiled-coil domain and serine/threonine kinase encoded by BCR exon 1 fused with exon 13 of PDGFRA, which retained both tyrosine kinase domains. During initial therapy, intensification, and consolidation, hyperleukocytosis persisted. Based on the presence of the BCR-PDGFRA fusion, single agent imatinib (Glivec) was administered. A complete hematological response was observed within 6 weeks as the presence of t(4;22) in the bone marrow went from a 70% down to 15%. However, the patient had a relapse in the central nervous system. Continued treatment with imatinib along with intrathecal chemotherapy achieved a meningeal remission after 2 weeks. According to the authors, this patient’s response implicates PDGFRA as a clinically actionable imatinib target.	12944919(PubMed)	PubMed		Trempat et al., 2003, Oncogene		3.0	accepted	7990	2971	38														Somatic	2020-04-21 17:18:23 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7990	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/2971	https://civicdb.org/links/genes/38	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	1

Post resection, multiple nodular metastases were found in both lungs and the disease progressed following treatments with cytotoxic agents and microwave ablation. Overexpression of PDGFRB was detected by IHC and a COL1A1-PDGFB fusion was detected by RT-PCR. Increased PDGFRB is activated by the COL1A1-PDGFB fusion product, which promotes the overactivation of downstream PDGFRB signaling pathways. Imatinib treatment failed as stable disease was followed by disease spread and progression. The patient was then treated with a daily oral dose of sunitinib (a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor) for 4 consecutive weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period. After 2 months on sunitinib, the patient experienced overall shrinkage of the body’s tumor mass (reduction of tumor in arm and partial response in lung and pancreas metastases). Sunitinib resulted in 9 months of progression free survival and improved quality of life. Ultimately, the disease progressed and the patient died 46 months after diagnosis.	29760553(PubMed)	PubMed		Xiao et al., 2018, Onco Targets Ther		3.0	accepted	7991	2972	4173														Somatic	2020-05-11 23:23:58 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7991	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/2972	https://civicdb.org/links/genes/4173	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	1

An initial analysis detected the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion and a NRASGly12Asp mutation. Initial therapies included chemotherapy and CAR-T infusion. Relapse 6 weeks after initial complete response to these therapies found a large increase in fusion transcripts and NTRK3 rearrangements were detectable by FISH in 50/50 blast nuclei whereas NRAS mutations were no longer detectable. The patient was treated with oral monotherapy larotrectinib (100mg twice per day). After 4 days on treatment peripheral blood blasts became undetectable; after 6 days on treatment lymphadenopathy and leukemia cutis resolved and a biopsy revealed an ablated bone marrow with only a few scattered blasts. The patient experienced clinical benefit with no apparent side effects during 42 days of larotrectinib treatment, however, patient eventually succumbed to multifocal angioinvasive aspergillosis because of insufficient recovery of normal hematopoiesis. Later sequencing of the NTRK3 kinase domain did not detect any larotrectinib resistance mutations (p.G623R, p.G696A).	31905241(PubMed)	PubMed		Nardi et al., 2020, Blood Adv		3.0	accepted	7993	801	3985	12	11802788.0	12022903.0			ENST00000396373.4	15	88483984.0	88418230.0	ENST00000394480.2	75.0	GRCh37		Somatic	2021-07-24 02:22:01 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7993	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/801	https://civicdb.org/links/genes/3985	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	1

Mouse xenografts treated with entrectinib at 10 or 30 mg/kg had complete remission while treatment with 3 mg/kg caused significant reduction in tumor growth.  Testing of the bone marrow of IMS-M2 xenografts after 3 weeks of treatment found no human CD45-positive cells in the 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg treatment groups; all vehicle treated mice had some human CD45-positive cells in their bone marrow.

Additionally, immunoblots showed gliteritinib reduced phosphorylation of FLT3 and downstream targets in Ba/F3 D835Y cells in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, in nude mice xenografted with Ba/F3 cells expressing D835Y, gilteritinib showed antitumor efficacy at 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, and induced tumor regression at 30 mg/k. Computational modelling demonstrated that gilteritinib interacts with activated FLT3 at the ATP-binding site, which is distant from the D835 containing activation loop.

The EBF1-PDGFRB transcript level measured using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction remained below detection limit (<2.5x102 copies/ microgram RNA) for 36 months post CBT. Furthermore, the patient maintained molecular remission during the 24 months post-CBT and the 12 months following completion of TKI administration, based on minimal residual disease (MRD) testing conducted every 6 months.	32068648(PubMed)	PubMed		Sakurai et al., 2020, J.

There were 116 patients identified for this trial, 51 of which met the conditions to be included. These 51 patients were split into two cohorts: 1) patients that had never been treated with a multikinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR and 2) patients that have previously been treated with a VEGFR multikinase inhibitor. In cohort 1, ten of 26 patients had best overall response. Best overall response was defined as the proportion of patients with a complete or partial response, however these ten patients were all partial response. In the same cohort 1, nine had achieved stable disease control for at least six months; therefore, 19 patients achieved disease control (73% of total cohort 1, 95% CI 52-88). In cohort 2, of 23 eligible patients, six had a partial response as best overall response and six had stable disease control for at least six months; therefore, 12 patients achieved disease control. (55% of total cohort 2, 95% CI 32-76). The authors conclude that vemurafenib is a potential treatment option for late-stage BRAF V600E-positive papillary thyroid cancer for treatment in patients naïve to a multikinase inhibitor (Cohort 1) and to patients that have been previously treated with a multikinase inhibitor (Cohort 2).	27460442(PubMed)	PubMed		Brose et al., 2016, Lancet Oncol.

It is one of the most widely studied variants in cancer. This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.

In B-ALL, the fusion commonly results from an intrachromosomal duplication involving chromosome 9, with breakpoints within the NUP214 and ABL1 genes. The fusion has been identified in 6% of cases of T-lymphoblastic leukemia and rare cases of B-lymphoblastic leukemia by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, single nucleotide polymorphism array, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and fluorescence in situ hybridization targeting the ABL1 gene. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the WD40 repeat and coiled-coil domains of NUP214 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and MAPK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways.

The fusion has been identified in 6% of cases of T-lymphoblastic leukemia and rare cases of B-lymphoblastic leukemia by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, single nucleotide polymorphism array, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and fluorescence in situ hybridization targeting the ABL1 gene. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the WD40 repeat and coiled-coil domains of NUP214 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and MAPK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The case report that illustrates the clinical significance of the NUP214-ABL1 fusion describes a 6-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia with normal karyotype. Both patients demonstrated minimal residual disease after induction chemotherapy, and later experienced relapse after either consolidation therapy or bone marrow transplant. Dasatinib was then prescribed and follow-up information is available for the older child, who successfully achieved a complete response for three months before succumbing to the disease. The clinical details of this case could predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).

FISH using a BCR-ABL1 probe demonstrated 50-80 extrachromosomal copies of ABL1; FISH using probes to the 3' regions of ABL1 and NUP214 confirmed NUP214-ABL1 amplification in ~99% of cells. The NUP214-ABL1 amplification was also confirmed by MLPA and SNP6.0 analysis. Additionally, this patient harbored a focal deletion of IKZF1 (exons 2-7) and CDKN2A/B (exons 1-2). Day 29 marrow showed complete morphological remission; however PCR-based IgVH MRD rearrangement studies revealed clonal IgVH rearrangement (1 in 10^4 cells). Patient underwent sibling donor allogenic stem cell transplant, and at 4 months is in complete remission. NUP214-ABL1 positive patient primary cells were cultured with various tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib). After 72-hour culture there was no significant reduction in viable cell numbers or increase in apoptosis, when compared to the no drug control. The in vitro sensitivity to TKIs may be attributed to variable NUP214-ABL1 copy number and/or focal deletions of IKZF1 and CDKN2A/B.	23175662(PubMed)	PubMed		Eyre et al., 2012, Blood		2.0	accepted	9150	2660	4	9	134000948.0	134106156.0			ENST00000359428.5	9	133730188.0	133763062.0	ENST00000318560.5	75.0	GRCh37	The NUP214 -ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the NUP214 (Nucleoporin 214) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein).

Two different RCSD1-ABL1 fusion transcripts, presumably resulting from alternative splicing, were identified, one consisting of the first three exons of RCSD1 fused to ABL1 starting from exon 4, the second of the first two exons of RCSD1 fused to exon 4 of ABL1. The patient received a modified CVAD induction therapy. After 2 induction courses, the BM had residual disease with 50% of leukemic blasts. At day 10 from the start of the 3rd induction regimen, dasatinib was introduced at a dose of 140 mg once daily. Two weeks later morphological remission was confirmed, and only minimal residual disease (1.5% of leukemic cells) was detectable by FISH. The first consolidation therapy consisted of dasatinib 140 mg once daily and high-dose methotrexate. BM at four weeks post consolidation showed complete morphological and cytogenetic remission (CCyR). Dasatinib was continued until an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed four months after diagnosis. After transplantation, no TKI therapy was used. At 12 months from HSCT, the patient experienced a cytogenetic relapse and a month later a hematologic relapse. Immunosuppressive drugs were discontinued, and the patient received a re-induction therapy with dasatinib 70 mg twice daily combined with one cycle of high-dose chemotherapy. The patient successfully reentered in CCyR, which has been maintained with dasatinib monotherapy for more than nine months.	19794096(PubMed)	PubMed		Mustjoki et al., 2009, Haematologica		3.0	accepted	9164	2681	4													The RCSD1-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the RCSD1 (RCS Domain Containing 1) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein).

During multiple periods of short remission and relapse she was treated with high risk induction chemotherapy, craniospinal irradiation and matched unrelated donor bone marrow transplant. Finally, WES and RNA-seq were performed on the tumor and normal samples, which identified a cryptic ETV6-ABL1 fusion as well as a biallelic CDKN2A deletion. She was administered imatinib and achieved a morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular remission, which were maintained for 18 months. After a fourth relapse, clinical sequencing was repeated and ultimately identified the persisting ETV6-ABL1 fusion (with no mutation identified in the kinase domain of ABL1) as well as a previously undetected MLL2-ADCY9 fusion resulting in truncation of MLL2 (also known as KMT2D). Treatments of Dasatinib, Ponatinib, and Panobinostat were unsuccessful and the patient ultimately succumbed to her disease 7 year after her initial diagnosis.	30028819(PubMed)	PubMed		Mankuzhy et al., 2019, J Pediatr Hematol Oncol		3.0	accepted	9171	2575	4														Somatic	2021-05-09 18:01:16 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9171	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/2575	https://civicdb.org/links/genes/4	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	1
1904	ABL1	25	RANBP2::ABL1	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma, BCR-ABL1–like	80650.0	Young adult onset	Dasatinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	This retrospective study reported the outcome of 24 patients with Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) harboring ABL-class fusions, who were treated with a combination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and chemotherapy. Of the 24 patients reported, 12 had fusions involving ABL1; in 7/12 patients the ABL1 fusion was detected at diagnosis, and in 5/12 it was identified at relapse. One relapse patient was found to have a RANBP2-ABL1 fusion. This patient was a 20 year old female. An IKZF1 intragenic deletion was detected in her leukemia in addition to the RANBP2-ABL1 fusion. She had good initial prednisone response and reached complete remission (CR) after treatment on the GRAALL2005R trial. However, she relapsed with refractory disease. The RANBP2-ABL1 fusion was detected at relapse, and dasatinib (140 mg daily) was added to chemotherapy; this resulted in a brief response even though her leukemia was previously refractory to several lines of salvage treatment (best MRD level 8x10-3). However, the patient experienced another relapse and died of progressive disease. The case illustrates partial response to TKIs in combination with chemotherapy in a relapsed Ph-like B-ALL with RANBP2-ABL1 fusion.	31434701(PubMed)	PubMed		Tanasi et al., 2019, Blood		2.0	accepted	9211	3268	4	2	109336063.0	109375004.0			ENST00000283195	9	133729451.0	133763062.0	ENST00000372348.2	75.0	GRCh37	The RANBP2-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the RANBP2 (RAN Binding Protein 2) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 18 of RANBP2 to exon 2 of ABL1 (RANBP2-ABL1 18-2).

This differential response to ponatinib as compared with dasatinib was confirmed in a secondary dose-response study and in mice inoculated with leukemia cells. Then the patient was started on ponatinib monotherapy (45 mg/day) based on her RCSD1-ABL1 fusion and achieved a remission. She received a second HSC transplant but relapsed at day 77 post transplantation. Ponatinib was restarted at this time that resulted in response but didn’t reach remission.

The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.

Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity.	34651095(PubMed)	PubMed		Mangum et al., 2021, JCO Precis Oncol		4.0	accepted	10360	3158	3984														Somatic	2022-06-01 00:25:50 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10360	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/3158	https://civicdb.org/links/genes/3984	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	1
1940	NTRK2	4915	KANK1::NTRK2	Glioblastoma	3068.0	Late young adult onset	Larotrectinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	An MRI of 26-year-old man presenting with motor weakness and language difficultly revealed a lesion in the left frontal lobe that extended across the corpus callosum. Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.	34041811(PubMed)	PubMed		Shepherd et al., 2021, Oncologist		3.0	accepted	10361	3158	3984														Somatic	2022-06-01 00:39:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10361	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/3158	https://civicdb.org/links/genes/3984	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	1

1942	IDH1	3417	R132	Cholangiocarcinoma	4947.0		Ivosidenib		Predictive	Supports	A	Sensitivity/Response	The multicenter randomized double-blind phase 3 study included patients with IDH1-mutant cholangiocarcinoma who had progressed on previous therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to Ivosidenib or placebo. Placebo to Ivosidenib crossover was permitted on radiological progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by independent central review. Progression-free survival was significantly improved with Ivosidenib compared with the placebo (median 2.7, vs 1.4 months; hazard ratio 0.37; 95% CI 0.25-0.54; one-side p<0.0001). Median overall survival was 10.8 months for the Ivosidenib group versus 9.7 months for the placebo group (HR 0.69 [95% CI 0.44-1.10]; p=0.060) in which 35 patients were crossover from the placebo group. In a prespecified exploratory analysis, the rank-preserving structural failure time (RPSFT) method was used to reconstruct the survival curve for patients receiving a placebo as if crossover had never occurred. RPSFT assumes that the treatment effect is the same for all patients, regardless of when the treatment is given. The RPSFT-adjusted median overall survival was 6.0 months for the placebo group (HR 0.46 [95% CI 0.28-0.75]; p=0.0008).	32416072(PubMed)	PubMed		Abou-Alfa et al., 2020, Lancet Oncol.

In myelodysplastic syndromes, IDH1 R132 mutations have been shown to be associated with worse outcome and shorter overall survival. They have also been linked to cytogenetically normal AML, an intermediate risk subtype of the disease. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1. Also in contrast to AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated with the specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.
