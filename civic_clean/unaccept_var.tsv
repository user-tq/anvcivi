1338	NTRK2	FUSION	A	Larotrectinib	Sensitivity/Response	A pooled analysis of three phase 1/2 clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in 159 NTRK fusion positive solid tumor patients (1 month - 84 years old) confirmed larotrectinib to be effective and safe in these patients. NTRK2 fusions were found in 4 of the 159 patients. Two cases NTRK2 fusion cases were shown to have reduction in tumor size with another tumor showing only minor growth.
1195	ALK	FUSION	A	Alectinib	Sensitivity/Response	In a phase 3 trial, 303 patients with NSCLC with ALK fusion were randomly assigned to alectinib arm (N=152) or crizotinib arm (N=151). PFS was significantly longer with alectinib than with crizotinib (HR for disease progression or death 0.47, 95% CI: 0.34-0.65, p<0.001). Investigator-assessed RR was 82.9% in alectinib arm and 75.5% in crizotinib arm. CNS RR in patients with measurable CNS lesions was 81% and 50% for alectinib and crizotinib, respectively. Eight patients in the alectinib group, in comparison to one patient with crizotinib, had a complete CNS response. Despite longer treatment duration for alectinib, there were fewer grade 3-5 adverse events compared with crizotinib treatment.
1194	ROS1	FUSION	A	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	In the ongoing phase 1 study, patients with NSCLC with ROS1 rearrangement received crizotinib. ORR was 72%, median duration of response was 24.7 months, mPFS was 19.3 months and mOS was 51.4 months.
1277	ROS1	REARRANGEMENT	A	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	A phase 2 clinical trial studied the efficacy of Crizotinib in East Asian NSCLC patients positive for ROS1 rearrangements (detected by RT-PCR AmoyDx assay) and negative for ALK1 rearrangements. Of the 127 patients enrolled, 17 achieved complete response and 74 achieved partial response. Overall response rate by independent radiology review was 71.7% (95% CI 63-79.3%) Time to response was rapid (median 1.9 months) and durable (Duration of response median 19.7 months). Median progression free survival was 15.9 months. Crizotinib was clinically beneficial regardless of demographics and prior therapy. Based on these results, Crizotinib was approved for the treatment of ROS1 positive NSCLC in 2017 in Japan, Taiwan, China, and Korea.
395	ALK	FUSION	A	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	In the Phase I study PROFILE 1001 (NCT00585195), a recommended crizotinib dose of 250 mg twice daily for 28 day cycles was established. Among 1,500 advanced NSCLC patients who were screened for ALK-rearrangement using a break-apart FISH assay, 82 patients were eligible for crizotinib treatment. Overall response rate was 57%, with 46 partial responses and one complete response. Since crizotinib inhibits MET, 33 patients with available tissue were screened for MET amplification and were found negative, further indicating that patient response was due to ALK inhibition. 31 patients were tested via RT-PCR for known EML4-ALK fusions, and 13 were shown to have EML4-ALK variant 1, four cases had variant 3, and one instance of variants 2, 3b and 5 were seen. 9 were unidentified, suggesting other fusion partners in these instances.
1139	NTRK1	FUSION	A	Larotrectinib	Sensitivity/Response	This was a Phase 1/2 study of 55 patients from 4 months to 76 years old with TRK-fusion positive tumors given NTRK inhibitor Larotrectinib. Patients had 17 unique NTRK fusion types. Patient overall response rate was 75% according to independent review and 80% according to investigator assessment. Authors state that Larotrectinib had durable anti tumor activity regardless of age or tumor type. 17/23 patients with NTRK1-fusion showed maximum percent change in tumor size between -30% and -100%.
1140	NTRK3	FUSION	A	Larotrectinib	Sensitivity/Response	This was a Phase 1/2 study of 55 patients from 4 months to 76 years old with TRK-fusion positive tumors given NTRK inhibitor Larotrectinib. Patients had 17 unique NTRK fusion types. Patient overall response rate was 75% according to independent review and 80% according to investigator assessment. Authors state that Larotrectinib had durable anti tumor activity regardless of age or tumor type. 26/27 patients with NTRK3-fusion showed maximum percent change in tumor size between -30% and -100%.
1310	ALK	FUSION	A	Alectinib	Sensitivity/Response	A randomized phase 3 trial (J-ALEX) of 207 Japanese ALK-positive NSCLC patients compared the efficacy and safety of alectinib (300mg twice daily) and crizotinib (250mg twice daily) in the first-line setting. When used as a first line treatment the median progression-free survival of the alectinib group was unreached (95% CI 17.5–not estimated) versus 10.2 months (95% CI 8.3–13.9) in the crizotinib group (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.17–0·57). In the overall intent to treat population, Alectinib showed improved median PFS (HR 0.34; 99.7% CI 0.17-0.71; stratified log-rank p<0·0001) with an unreached PFS (95% CI 20.3-not estimated) compared to 10.2 months (95% CI 8.2-12.0) for crizotinib. The safety profile of alectinib was favorable relative to crizotinib with fewer dose interruptions (29% vs 74%) and fewer grade 3-4 adverse events (26% vs 52%).
344	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	A	Neratinib	Sensitivity/Response	In this two arm, Phase III study (NCT00878709) of the efficacy of a 12 month course of the TKI neratinib after trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy of early stage HER2-positive breast cancer was assessed using invasive disease-free survival as primary endpoint. HER2 positivity was assessed via FISH. At 2 year follow-up, 70 vs. 109 disease-free survival events had occurred and disease-free survival rates were 93.9% vs. 91.6% (significant) in neratinib vs. placebo groups respectively. Distant disease-free survival and time to distant recurrence were similar in both groups. These results are an interesting contrast to results of long-term adjuvant therapy with trastuzumab (HERA) which did not show significant benefit.
26	MGMT	PROMOTER METHYLATION	A	Temozolomide	Sensitivity/Response	In a randomized clinical trial, patients with MGMT promoter methylation benefitted from temozolomide. This benefit was also methylation status dependent, as those without methylation did not see increased survival.
445	ALK	FUSION	A	Alectinib	Sensitivity/Response	In this Phase II trial of 87 patients (NCT01871805), alectinib was assayed for safety and efficacy in ALK positive NSCLC that had progressed on crizotinib. Of 69 patients with measurable disease, 35 achieved objective response, with median duration of response 13.5 months. Of 16 patients with measurable CNS disease, four achieved CNS complete response and 8 showed CNS partial response. median duration of CNS response was 11.1 months. 2 deaths were observed, and 1 was judged related to study treatment.
406	ALK	FUSION	A	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	This phase 3 trial named PROFILE 1014 (NCT01154140) compared crizotinib to established chemotherapy in first-line treatment for this disease. The study consisted of 343 patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC that tested positive for ALK rearrangement via break-apart FISH assay, and had no prior systemic treatment. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to crizotinib (N=172) or pemetrexed with cisplatin or carboplatin (N=171). Progression free survival was significantly longer with crizotinib treatment than chemotherapy (10.9 vs. 7.0 months; hazard ratio for progression or death with crizotinib, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.60;P<0.001), and objective response rate was higher with crizotinib treatment than chemotherapy (75% vs. 45%, P<0.001). Improvement in quality of life was also reported.
345	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	A	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	In this two arm, Phase III study (NCT00878709) of the efficacy of a 12 month course of the TKI neratinib after trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy of early stage HER2-positive breast cancer was assessed using invasive disease-free survival as primary endpoint. HER2 positivity was assessed via FISH. At 2 year follow-up, 70 vs. 109 disease-free survival events had occurred and disease-free survival rates were 93.9% vs. 91.6% (significant) in neratinib vs. placebo groups respectively. Distant disease-free survival and time to distant recurrence were similar in both groups. These results are an interesting contrast to results of long-term adjuvant therapy with trastuzumab (HERA) which did not show significant benefit.
1323	EZH2	ACTIVATING MUTATION	A	Tazemetostat	Sensitivity/Response	Tazemetostat was found to have significantly increased anti-tumor activity in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma with gain-of-function EZH2 mutations (cobas EZH2 Mutation Test; objective response rate of 69%) versus patients with wild-type EZH2 (objective response rate of 35%). Treatment shows good tolerability and durability of response in both groups of patients.
348	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	A	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	HERA was a Phase III trial assessing application of trastuzumab in an extended adjuvant setting.  Patients were HER2 positive with completely excised invasive BC, node positive or negative, and having undergone prior adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.  In the 3 arm study patients were given trastuzumab courses of 1 year, 2 years, or untreated.  At the first planned interim analysis, trastuzumab treatment for one year was compared with observation alone.  A significant difference in disease-free survival was seen with 220 DFS events out of 1693 in the observation arm versus 127 DFS events out of 1694 in the 1 year trastuzumab arm.  1 year adjuvant trastuzumab is currently the standard of care.
549	PDGFRB	FUSION	A	Imatinib	Sensitivity/Response	Twelve patients with BCR-ABL-negative chronic myeloproliferative disease and reciprocal translocations involving PDGFRB received imatinib for a median of 47 months (range, 0.1-60 months). Eleven had prompt responses, 10 had complete resolution of cytogenetic abnormalities and decrease or disappearance of fusion transcripts as measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Updates were sought from 8 further patients previously described in the literature; prompt responses were described in 7 and persist in 6.
405	ALK	FUSION	A	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	This two arm Phase III study named PROFILE 1007 (NCT00932893) was performed to assess crizotinib vs. established chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer patients positive for ALK rearrangement (assessed by break-apart FISH) with locally advanced or metastatic disease. 347 patients with disease progression after one round of platinum-based chemotherapy were randomized to receive crizotinib (N=173) or chemotherapy (N=174) consisting of pemetrexed in pemetrexed-naive patients and docetaxel for patients previously treated with pemetrexed. The primary endpoint - progression free survival (PFS) - was found to be significantly better for patients treated with crizotinib (median 7.7 months) than with chemotherapy (median 3.0 months) (hazard ratio for disease progression or death with crizotinib, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.64; P<0.001). Response rates were 65% for crizotinib treatment and 20% for chemotherapy (P<0.001). Improvements in quality of life were also reported.
1196	ALK	FUSION	A	Ceritinib	Sensitivity/Response	In a phase 3 trial, patients with previously treatmented NSCLC with ALK fusion were randomly assigned to ceritinib or chemotherapy. Ceritinib showed a significant improvement in median  PFS compared with chemotherapy (5·4 months [95% CI 4·1-6·9] for ceritinib vs 1·6 months [1·4-2·8] for chemotherapy; hazard ratio 0·49 [0·36-0·67]; p<0·0001).
666	DPYD	RS67376798 HOMOZYGOSITY	A	Fluorouracil	Adverse Response	The Clinical Pharmacogenomics Implementation Consortium Guidelines for DPYD genotype and 5-FU dosing does not recommend the use of 5-FU or capecitabine in patients with homozygous DPYD*2A, *13 or rs67376798 and the FDA drug labels warn to use precautions in this patient population.
550	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	A	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	ToGA, a Phase III study (NCT01041404) addressed use of trastuzumab in HER2 positive (overexpression or amplification) advanced gastric cancer, where chemotherapy using fluoropyrimidine-based and platinum-based combinations had been common practice.  Patients were given a chemotherapy regime containing capecitabine, flourouracil and cisplatin with (n=298) or without (n=296) trastuzumab, and had not been previously treated for metastatic cancer.  Study endpoint was overall survival, which was significantly different in the two populations (13.8 months with chemotherapy + trastuzumab and 11.1 months for chemotherapy alone).  The authors conclude that trastuzumab should be a standard option for HER2 positive advanced gastric cancer.

656	UGT1A1	UGT1A1*28	A	Belinostat	Adverse Response	The FDA approved package insert for Belinostat recommends dose adjustment for UGT1A1*28 allele homozygotes.
660	DPYD	DPYD*2A HOMOZYGOSITY	A	Tegafur	Adverse Response	The Clinical Pharmacogenomics Implementation Consortium Guidelines for DPYD genotype and 5-FU dosing does not recommend the use of 5-FU or capecitabine in patients with homozygous DPYD*2A, *13 or rs67376798 and the FDA drug labels warn to use precautions in this patient population.
381	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Trastuzumab Emtansine	Sensitivity/Response	The EMILIA study (NCT00829166) was a Phase II trial to assess the efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, n=495) in comparison to lapatinib plus capecitabine (n=496), in treatment of advanced HER2 positive breast cancer.  Patients were required to have progressed on or after treatments involving trastuzumab and a taxane, and no prior exposure to lapatinib or T-DM1.   Primary endpoints included independently assessed progression free survival (PFS) and safety. PFS was 9.6 months in T-DM1 group vs. 6.4 months in lapatinib plus capecitabine.  Rates of adverse events of grade 3 or higher were greater with lapatinib plus capecitabine.  These results, together with other trials such as TH3RESA indicate promise for T-DM1 therapy in HER2 amplification, and this will be further studied in an arm of the NCI-MATCH trial.
376	CDKN2A	P16 EXPRESSION	B	Afatinib	Resistance	Phase III trial to compare afatinib or metothrexate in recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. 483 patients were randomized to either afatinib (n=322) or methotrexate (n=161). 285 patients were assessed for p16 Status (IHC). In the post-hoc analysis, benefit of afatinib compared with methotrexate was more pronounced in p16-negative disease (HR 0·69 [95% CI 0·50–0·96], p=0.022) than in p16-positive disease (HR 0·95 [CI 0·51–1·75], p=0.67, interaction test p=0·32).
380	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Trastuzumab Emtansine	Sensitivity/Response	The Phase III trial, TH3RESA (NCT01419197), was performed in patients with advanced HER2 breast cancer that was heavily pretreated.  Patients were required to have prior exposure to trastuzumab and lapatinib as well as a taxane.  This patient population has not seen many studies, responds poorly to late-line treatment with trastuzumab, and in this study was treated with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, n=404) vs. physician's choice (usually trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, n=198).  Results showed progression free survival was 6.2 months in T-DM1 treatment vs. 3.3 months under physician's choice, along with lower incidence of grade 3 or worse events with T-DM1.  The authors conclude that their findings in this heavily pretreated population, along with findings in the EMILIA trial, indicate promise for antibody-drug conjugates.  The NCI-MATCH trial with further study T-DM1 in the context of HER2 amplification.
379	MMP2	SERUM LEVELS	B	Bevacizumab	Sensitivity/Response	Plasma levels of 11 potential biomarkers were tested at baseline and 2 weeks after bevacizumab initiation in a prospective cohort of 26 patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas. Results were validated in a separate retrospective cohort (n = 50) and also tested in patients treated with cytotoxic agents without bevacizumab (n = 34). MMP2 level was correlated with PFS (hazard ratio, 3.92; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.46-10.52; P = .007) and OS (hazard ratio, 4.62; 95% CI: 1.58-13.53; P = .005) in the discovery and validation cohorts but not in patients treated without bevacizumab.
1003	FGFR2	FUSION	B	Infigratinib	Sensitivity/Response	This Phase II trial of BGJ398 for FGFR2 aberant cholangiocarcinoma included 48 patients with FGFR2 fusions. Among these patients with FGFR2 fusions, eight showed tumor response (18.8%) and thirty-six showed tumor shrinkage (75%).
992	RRM1	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Gemcitabine	Sensitivity/Response	There were 68 patients enrolled in this study, 28 of which were treated with gemcitabine.  Of those 28, 14 patients had a low RRM1 expression and 14 had a high RRM1 expression. Only the patients with low RRM1 expression received a significant benefit from gemcitabine (p=0.0010) whereas the benefit for those with a high RRM1 expression was not significantly better (p=0.3309).  The study also tested the role of ERCC1 expression and its correlation to RRM1 expression. It was found that patients with a combined high RRM1 and ERCC1 expression had good prognosis with the highest survival rate (P=0.0127).
1004	EGFR	AMPLIFICATION	B	Gefitinib	Sensitivity/Response	The result of the analysis found that EGFR gene copy number was associated with increased OS and PFS, supporting the idea that EGFR gene copy number is a biomarker for response to EGFR-TKI therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC.
378	MMP9	SERUM LEVELS	B	Bevacizumab	Resistance	MMP9 serum levels were assessed (ELISA) at baseline (b) and before surgery in 45 available samples from patients with inflammatory breast cancer treated with bevacizumab-based neoadjuvant therapy. Low bMMP9 was correlated with better OS (p=0.022) and non-significantly associated with longer DFS (p=0.071). Correlation to DFS was also found after multivariate analysis (p=0.041, HR: 3.511). bMMP9 was associated with death (p=0.035). During treatment, a significant decrease in MMP9 levels (p<0.001) was observed in 87% of patients.
377	MMP2	SERUM LEVELS	B	Bevacizumab	Sensitivity/Response	MMP2 serum levels were assessed (ELISA) at baseline (b) and before surgery in 45 available samples from patients with inflammatory breast cancer treated with bevacizumab-based neoadjuvant therapy. High bMMP2 was correlated with better disease-free survival (DFS, p=0.001) and overall survival (OS, p=0.032). Correlation to DFS was also found after multivariate analysis (p=0.003, Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.115). bMMP2 was associated with relapse (p=0.002) and death (p=0.049). During treatment, significant increase in MMP2 was observed in 100% of patients.
993	RRM1	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Gemcitabine	Sensitivity/Response	In this study, human pancreatic carcinoma cell line MiaPaCa2, which is a gemcitabine-sensitive cell line, was used for the establishment of chemoresistant cells MiaPaCa2-RG. Analysis for identifying genetic alterations relating to gemcitabine resistance revealed that RRM1 was the most upregulated gene with a 4.5 fold expression. RRM1-speciﬁc RNAi transfection significantly reduced the gemcitabine chemoresistance of MiaPaCa2-RG to the same level as that of gemcitabine sensitive MiaPaCa2. Moreover, gemcitabine response of MiaPaCa2 also became more sensitive.  Next, patients with pancreatic cancer were recruited and 18 tissue samples were taken. The patients with a low RRM1 expression had a significantly better outcome after gemcitabine treatment than those patients with high RRM1 expression (P=0.016).
366	TP53	WILDTYPE	B	Adjuvant Chemotherapy	Sensitivity/Response	Pooled analysis of TP53 mutations (exons 5-8) from 4 randomized trials (IALT, JBR10, CALGB-9633 and ANITA, 1209 patients, median follow-up 5.5 years) of platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) versus observation (OBS). Patients with wild-type TP53 had better outcomes with ACT than OBS (HROS=0.77 [0.62-0.95], p=0.02; HRDFS=0.75 [0.62-0.92], p=0.005).
994	RRM1	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Gemcitabine	Sensitivity/Response	In this study, 229 tumors were analyzed for RRM1 expression. This resulted in 146 that were negative for RRM1 expression and 83 that were positive. These tumors were studied for a relationship between RRM1 expression and chemotherapy regimens, gemcitabine, docetaxel and carboplatin, and vinorelbine and carboplatin. In the patients receiving gemcitabine treatment, the progression-free survival of RRM1-negative patients was significantly higher than that of RRM1-positive patients (8.8 months vs. 7.6 months, P = 0.01). The patients that were positive for RRM1 expression, had a better response to docetaxel or vinorelbine treatment than gemcitabine (P=0.047 and P=0.047). However, there were no differences of response to docetaxel and vinorelbine in regards to RRM1 expression.
995	RRM1	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Vinorelbine	Sensitivity/Response	The study began with a total of 443 patients that were randomly assigned to either regimen A (Paclitaxel and cisplatin with gemcitabine) or regimen B ( cisplatin and vinorelbine). Of those patients, 261 had tissue available for RRM1 evaluation. In regimen B, survival increased significantly in patients with low RRM1 expression as compared to those with a high expression (P=0.046). However, in regimen A, the increase in survival for patients with low RRM1 expression as opposed to those with a high RRM1 expression was not as significant (P=0.366).
996	RRM1	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Paclitaxel	Sensitivity/Response	The study began with a total of 443 patients that were randomly assigned to either regimen A (Paclitaxel and cisplatin with gemcitabine) or regimen B ( cisplatin and vinorelbine). Of those patients, 261 had tissue available for RRM1 evaluation. In regimen B, survival increased significantly in patients with low RRM1 expression as compared to those with a high expression (P=0.046). However, in regimen A, the increase in survival for patients with low RRM1 expression as opposed to those with a high RRM1 expression was not as significant (P=0.366).
998	CD274	EXPRESSION	B	Pembrolizumab	Sensitivity/Response	PD-L1 expression in at least 50% of tumor cells correlated with improved efficacy of pembrolizumab.
999	BRCA1	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	B	Olaparib	Sensitivity/Response	302 patients (234 with progression events) with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer and with a confirmed deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutation (164 BRCA1, 129 BRCA2) had significantly improved progression-free survival and better response rate to olaparib (PARP inhibitor) than standard therapy (7.0 mo vs 4.2 mo, hazard ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.43-0.8) in this randomized phase 3 trial (NCT02000622). For BRCA1 patients specifically, the hazard ratio was 0.54, 95% CI 0.37-0.79).
990	ATM	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Paclitaxel	Sensitivity/Response	A randomized phase 2 trial investigating the efficiency of Olaparib plus Paclitaxel vs. Placebo plus Paclitaxel in recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer patients. 123 patients received treatment. Combination treatment did not significantly improve ORR (26,4% vs 19,1%) or PFS (3,91m vs 3,55 m) but OS (13,8 m vs. 8,3 m) in the overall cohort.  A subcohort of ATM low expressing tumours (14%) experienced a greater improvement of OS (not reached vs. 8,2 m) and a trend towards improved PFS (5,29 m vs 3,68 m).
1000	BRCA2	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	B	Olaparib	Sensitivity/Response	302 patients (234 with progression events) with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer and with a confirmed deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutation (164 BRCA1, 129 BRCA2) had significantly improved progression-free survival and better response rate to olaparib (PARP inhibitor) than standard therapy (7.0 mo vs 4.2 mo, hazard ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.43-0.8) in this randomized phase 3 trial (NCT02000622). For BRCA2 patients specifically, the hazard ratio was 0.68, 95% CI 0.45-0.1.07.
1001	MET	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Rilotumumab	Sensitivity/Response	In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, 609 patients with MET+ (expression of at least 1+ intensity on 25% or more tumor cells) gastric cancer or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma were randomized to chemotherapy (epirubicin, cisplatin, capecitabine) with placebo or MET inhibitor rilotumumab. Study treatment was stopped early because of a higher number of deaths in the rilotumumab arm. Median overall survival was 8·8 months (95% CI 7·7-10·2) in the rilotumumab group compared with 10·7 months (9·6-12·4) in the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio 1·34, 95% CI 1·10-1·63; p=0·003).

Patients with TP53wt had significantly better PFS and OS with ACT vs. OBS (p=0.005, p=0.02, respectively) whereas patients with TP53 mutations did not show significant differences in PFS and OS between ACT and OBS (p=0.86, p=0.63).
1002	PTEN	LOSS	B	Everolimus	Sensitivity/Response	In a single-arm, open label phase 2 trial in PIK3CA amplified/mutated and/or PTEN loss encompassing 10 patients, no objective responses were observed but a stable disease response in 4 patients, resulting in a median PFS of 1.4 months. Everolimus failed to meet its enpoint.
997	RRM1	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Gemcitabine	Sensitivity/Response	The study began with a total of 443 patients that were randomly assigned to either regimen A (Paclitaxel and cisplatin with gemcitabine) or regimen B ( cisplatin and vinorelbine). Of those patients, 261 had tissue available for RRM1 evaluation. In regimen B, survival increased significantly in patients with low RRM1 expression as compared to those with a high expression (P=0.046). However, in regimen A, the increase in survival for patients with low RRM1 expression as opposed to those with a high RRM1 expression was not as significant (P=0.366).
390	CD274	EXPRESSION	B	Pembrolizumab	Sensitivity/Response	Meta-Analysis of PD-L1 (CD274) Expression Status in 914 patients (7 studies) and response to PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies. Patients with PD-L1 positive tumors (PD-L1 tumor cell staining ≥1%), had a significantly higher ORR, compared to patients with PD-L1 negative tumors (OR: 2.44; 95% CIs: 1.61-3.68).
385	HSPH1	T17 DELETION	B	Fluorouracil	Sensitivity/Response	329 consecutive patients with stage II–III colorectal tumors with MSI after surgical resection at tertiary medical centers were screened for HSP110 T(17) by PCR. Patients underwent adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin. Patients with large HSP110 T(17) deletions (≥5 bp; 18 of 77 patients, 23.4%) had longer times of relapse-free survival than patients with small or no deletions (≤4 bp; 59 of 77 patients, 76.6%) in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 0.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.012–0.8; P = .03). A significant interaction between chemotherapy and T17 deletion was found (P =.009).
969	RET	FUSION	B	Cabozantinib	Sensitivity/Response	RET rearrangements are found in 1-2% of non-small-cell lung cancers. Cabozantinib is a multikinase inhibitor with activity against RET that produced a 10% overall response in unselected patients with lung cancers. This was an open-label, two-stage, single-centre, phase 2, single-arm trial in the USA in metastatic/unresectable lung cancer harbouring RET rearrangement. 26 Patients with lung adenocarcinomas were given 60 mg of cabozantinib orally per day. The primary objective was overall response. Confirmed PR was seen in 7/25 (ORR 28% [95% CI 12–49%]) response-evaluable patients, meeting the primary endpoint. KIF5B-RET was the predominant fusion in 16 (62%) patients.
970	RET	FUSION	B	Vandetanib	Sensitivity/Response	RET rearrangements involving RET are found in about 1% of NSCLC and define a unique molecular subset.  This study was a multi-center, open-label, phase II clinical trial to examine the safety and efficacy of Vandetanib (300 mg/d) in RET positive NSCLC patients (confirmed by FISH), Primary endpoint was the objective response rate. 18 patients were enrolled, the majority were a heavily pretreated population. Among the 17 evaluable patients, three had a partial response (ORR = 18%) and eight had a stable disease (DCR = 65%). Among these patients, the PR or SD was durable for more than 6 months in 8 patients. Vandetanib also showed a PFS of 4.5 months, and an OS of 11.6 months during a median follow-up duration of 14 months.
971	RET	FUSION	B	Vandetanib	Sensitivity/Response	We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of vandetanib in patients with advanced RET-rearranged NSCLC. In this open-label, multicentre, phase 2 trial (LURET), patients with advanced RET-rearranged NSCLC continuously received 300 mg of oral vandetanib daily. 1536 patients with EGFR mutation-negative NSCLC were screened, 34 were RET-positive (2%). 19 were enrolled and 17 patients were eligible for primary analysis.   9 patients (53%) achieved an objective response. At data cutoff, median PFS was 4.7 months.
415	ALK	FUSION	B	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	As part of a phase 1 dose-escalation trial (NCT00939770), seven patients between ages 12 months and 22 years with relapsed or refractory inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors with ALK-rearrangement were given crizotinib. In six patients with measurable disease, responses included 3 with partial response and 3 with stable disease. One patient with evaluable disease had stable disease with treatment ongoing at the time of publication. Crizotinib was well tolerated in this group of pediatric patients.
413	PTEN	DELETION	B	Everolimus	Sensitivity/Response	In a phase II trial on castration-resistant prostate cancer patients, FISH detection of PTEN deletion was associated with increased progression free survival (p=0.07) and with improved PSA response (p=0.02) in response to everolimus, an mTOR pathway inhibitor.
973	CD274	EXPRESSION	B	Durvalumab	Sensitivity/Response	In this meta-analysis of 14 studies with 2857 patients, the immunotherapy response rate was higher among PD-L1-positive patients (RR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.63-2.94). PD-L1 expression was also related to better progression-free survival (HR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.57-0.85) and better overall survival (HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67-0.89).
974	CD274	EXPRESSION	B	Nivolumab	Sensitivity/Response	In this meta-analysis of 14 studies with 2857 patients, the immunotherapy response rate was higher among PD-L1-positive patients (RR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.63-2.94).

408	ALK	FUSION	B	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	This prospective Phase III study named Profile 1014 on NSCLC ALK-rearranged patients assessed intracranial disease control rate (IC-DCR) in the subset of patients entering the study with preexisting treated brain metastasis (tBM). IC-DCR was significantly improved in the tBM group given crizotinib (N=39) over chemotherapy (pemetrexed + cisplatin or carboplatin; N=40) at 12 weeks (85% vs. 45%, P<0.001), and at 24 weeks (56% vs. 25%, P=0.006). Progression free survival was also significantly improved with crizotinib over chemotherapy in the tBM subgroup (9.0 vs. 4.0 months; HR 0.40; P<0.001), where in the intent to treat population it was 10.9 vs. 7.0 months (HR 0.45; P<0.001), indicating that the difficult to treat BM population obtained benefit from crizotinib at both the brain and systemic level.
407	ALK	FUSION	B	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	This retrospective study of patients from the PROFILE 1001 and 1005 studies of crizotinib in advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC assessed the potential benefit of crizotinib beyond progressive disease (CBPD), defined as continuation of crizotinib for 3 or more weeks after disease progression on crizotinib. 194 patients who had developed PD by data cutoff were studied, where 120 received crizotinib for a median duration of 19.4 weeks and 74 discontinued crizotinib after PD. No gross imbalances in clinicopathologic features of the two groups were evident.  Significantly longer overall survival was observed in the crizotinib continuing group from time of PD (16.4 vs. 3.9 months; hazard ratio 0.27, 95% CI: 0.17–0.42; P < 0.0001), and from the time of initial crizotinib (29.6 vs. 10.8 months; HR 0.30, 95% CI: 0.19–0.46; P < 0.0001).
977	CD274	EXPRESSION	B	Atezolizumab	Sensitivity/Response	In this meta-analysis of 14 studies with 2857 patients, the immunotherapy response rate was higher among PD-L1-positive patients (RR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.63-2.94). PD-L1 expression was also related to better progression-free survival (HR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.57-0.85) and better overall survival (HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67-0.89).
978	ALK	FUSION	B	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	In a randomized, open-label phase 3 trial 303 patients with ALK-positive, previously untreated NSCLC (including asympt. CNS disease) were randomized to reiceive either Alectinib or Crizotinib. During a median follow-up of 17.6 months (crizotinib) and 18.6 months (alectinib), an event of disease progression/death occurred in 41% (62/152  pt) in the alectinib group and 68% (102/151 patients) in the crizotinib group. 12-month event-free survival rate 68.4% with alectinib vs. 48.7% with crizotinib. A total of 18 patients (12%) in the alectinib group had an event of CNS progression, compared to 68 patients (45%) in the crizotinib group. Response rates were 82.9% (Alectinib) and 75.5% (crizotinib).
384	HSPH1	T17 DELETION	B	Oxaliplatin	Sensitivity/Response	329 consecutive patients with stage II–III colorectal tumors with MSI after surgical resection at tertiary medical centers were screened for HSP110 T(17) by PCR. Patients underwent adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin. Patients with large HSP110 T(17) deletions (≥5 bp; 18 of 77 patients, 23.4%) had longer times of relapse-free survival than patients with small or no deletions (≤4 bp; 59 of 77 patients, 76.6%) in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 0.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.012–0.8; P = .03).

979	ALK	FUSION	B	Alectinib	Sensitivity/Response	In a randomized, open-label phase 3 trial 303 patients with ALK-positive, previously untreated NSCLC (including asympt. CNS disease) were randomized to reiceive either Alectinib or Crizotinib. During a median follow-up of 17.6 months (crizotinib) and 18.6 months (alectinib), an event of disease progression/death occurred in 41% (62/152  pt) in the alectinib group and 68% (102/151 patients) in the crizotinib group. 12-month event-free survival rate 68.4% with alectinib vs. 48.7% with crizotinib. A total of 18 patients (12%) in the alectinib group had an event of CNS progression, compared to 68 patients (45%) in the crizotinib group. Response rates were 82.9% (Alectinib) and 75.5% (crizotinib).
986	BRCA1	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	B	Talazoparib	Sensitivity/Response	In part 2 of a two-part dose-escalation phase I trial (NCT01286987), 71 patients with Ewings sarcoma, breast, ovarian, small cell lung, or pancreatic cancers received 1.0 mg/day talazoparib treatment. Of patients with BRCA mutation-associated breast and ovarian cancers, confirmed responses were observed in 7 of 14 (50%) and 5 of 12 (42%) patients, respectively.
987	EGFR	EXPRESSION	B	Gefitinib	Sensitivity/Response	Double blind Phase II clinical trial evaluated 208 patients for efficacy of gefitinib against non-small cell lung cancer. For individuals taking 250mg/day, they observed an objective response rate of 18.4%, a PFS of 2.7 months and a median overall survival of 7.6 months. For individuals taking 500mg/day objective response rate was 19%, PFS was 2.8 months, and median overall survival was 8.0 months. For those who responded, median duration of the response was 3 months (ranges=1-5.5 months). The disease control rate was found to be 54.4% and 51.4% for the two groups.
988	EGFR	GAIN-OF-FUNCTION	B	Gefitinib	Sensitivity/Response	Study found somatic EGFR mutations localized to exons 19,21 in 8/9 patients who exhibited a response to Gefitinib treatment. Of these mutations 7/8 were localized near the ATP cleft Gefitinib targets, suggesting a specific gain-of-function mechanism. No EGFR mutations were observed in 7 patients with no response to Gefitinib. An expansion cohort independent of the Gefitinib study showed 2/25 patients harbored EGFR mutations. A second expansion independent of Gefitinib consisting of 95 tumors and 108 cell lines showed no mutations in exons 19,21.
989	ATM	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Olaparib	Sensitivity/Response	A randomized phase 2 trial investigating the efficiency of Olaparib plus Paclitaxel vs. Placebo plus Paclitaxel in recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer patients. 123 patients received treatment. Combination treatment did not significantly improve ORR (26,4% vs 19,1%) or PFS (3,91m vs 3,55 m) but OS (13,8 m vs. 8,3 m) in the overall cohort.  A subcohort of ATM low expressing tumours (14%) experienced a greater improvement of OS (not reached vs. 8,2 m) and a trend towards improved PFS (5,29 m vs 3,68 m).
394	ALK	FUSION	B	Ceritinib	Sensitivity/Response	Updated results from ASCEND-1 trial assessing safety and activity of ceritinib in ALK rearranged locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. 255 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of ceritinib 750 mg/day, of whom 246 had ALK-rearranged NSCLC (Median follow-up: 11.1 months). Overall response rate was 72% [95% CI 61-82] of 83 ALK inhibitor-naive patients and 56% [49-64] of 163 ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients. Median duration of response was 17·0 months (95% CI 11.3-non-estimable [NE]) in ALK inhibitor-naive patients and 8.3 months (6.8-9.7) in ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients. Median progression-free survival was 18.4 months (95% CI 11.1-NE) in ALK inhibitor-naive patients and 6.9 months (5.6-8.7) in ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients. Brain metastases control was reported in 79% [95% CI 54-94] of 19 ALK inhibitor-naive patients and in 65% [54-76] of 75 ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients.
393	CD274	EXPRESSION	B	Atezolizumab	Sensitivity/Response	Exploratory biomarker analysis from a phase-II randomized trial comparing atezolizumab (PD-L1) and docetaxel in previously treated, advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Baseline PD-L1 expression (IHC) was assessed in tumour cells (as percentage of PD-L1-expressing tumour cells TC3≥50%, TC2≥5% and <50%, TC1≥1% and <5%, and TC0<1%) and tumour-infiltrating immune cells (as percentage of tumour area: IC3≥10%, IC2≥5% and <10%, IC1≥1% and <5%, and IC0<1%). Increasing PD-L1 Expression was associated with improved overall survival (TC3 or IC3 HR 0·49 [0·22-1·07; p=0·068], TC2/3 or IC2/3 HR 0·54 [0·33-0·89; p=0·014], TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 HR 0·59 [0·40-0·85; p=0·005], TC0 and IC0 HR 1·04 [0·62-1·75; p=0·871]) but not progression free survival or overall response rate.
392	TP53	DELETERIOUS MUTATION	B	Pazopanib	Sensitivity/Response	19 advanced sarcoma patients treated with pazopanib were retrospectively assessed for mutations associated with response using the Foundation one sarcoma/heme panel. Progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with TP53 mutations (all predicted to be loss of function) was significantly greater than TP53 wild-type tumors with the median PFS of 208 versus 136 days, respectively [P = 0.036, hazards ratio 0.38 (95% confidence interval 0.09-0.83)].
391	CD274	EXPRESSION	B	Nivolumab	Sensitivity/Response	Meta-Analysis of PD-L1 (CD274) Expression Status in 914 patients (7 studies) and response to PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies.

387	ROBO4	EXPRESSION	B	Angiogenesis Inhibitor	Sensitivity/Response	Biomarkers for Response to antiangiogenic treatment were screened for in hepatocellular cancer (n = 11), renal cell cancer (n = 7) and non-small cell lung cancer (n = 2). Increased expression of tumor endothelial markers: Robo4 and ECSCR, nonsignificantly correlated with prolonged antiangiogenic time to progression (ECSCR high = 275 days vs. ECSCR low = 92.5 days; p = 0.07 and for Robo4 high = 387 days vs. Robo4 low = 90.0 days; p = 0.08).
386	ECSCR	EXPRESSION	B	Angiogenesis Inhibitor	Sensitivity/Response	Biomarkers for response to antiangiogenic treatment were screened for in hepatocellular cancer (n = 11), renal cell cancer (n = 7) and non-small cell lung cancer (n = 2). Increased expression of tumor endothelial markers: Robo4 and ECSCR, nonsignificantly correlated with prolonged antiangiogenic time to progression (ECSCR high = 275 days vs. ECSCR low = 92.5 days; p = 0.07 and for Robo4 high = 387 days vs. Robo4 low = 90.0 days; p = 0.08).
985	BRCA2	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	B	Talazoparib	Sensitivity/Response	In part 2 of a two-part dose-escalation phase I trial (NCT01286987), 71 patients with Ewings sarcoma, breast, ovarian, small cell lung, or pancreatic cancers received 1.0 mg/day talazoparib treatment. Of patients with BRCA mutation-associated breast and ovarian cancers, confirmed responses were observed in 7 of 14 (50%) and 5 of 12 (42%) patients, respectively.
360	FLT3	ITD	B	Selumetinib	Resistance	Forty-seven patients with relapsed/refractory AML or 60+ years old with untreated AML were enrolled on a phase II study. In FLT3 wild-type patients, six out of 36 (17%) had a response (1 PR, 3 MR, 2 uMR) that lasted a median of 58 days (range, 33–273 days). No patient with FLT3-ITD (n = 10) responded. One patient with unknown FLT3 status also had no response. Of note, this study did not meet its primary endpoint of 6 responses (CR, CRi, PR or MR) in the first 35 patients enrolled.
349	EGFR	VIII	B	Erlotinib	Sensitivity/Response	Expression of EGFRvIII and PTEN was evaluated in 26 patients with glioblastomas treated with erlotinib or gefitinib and no EGFR or Her2/neu kinase domain mutations. 7 patients responded to treatment while 19 progressed rapidly. Coexpression of EGFRvIII and PTEN was associated with clinical response (defined as 25% tumor shrinkage). These results were confirmed using IHC in an independent cohort of 33 patients (8 responders) treated with erlotinib at another institution.
1007	EGFR	AMPLIFICATION	B	Gefitinib	Sensitivity/Response	Among TKI-treated patients, increased EGFR gene copy number appears to be associated with improved survival outcomes.
317	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Lapatinib	Sensitivity/Response	TyTAN, a Phase III study in Asian patients, looked at addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib to chemptherapy in advanced HER2 positive gastric cancer.  Primary endpoint was Overall Survival (OS).  Participants had progressed under previous treatment and only a small percentage had seen first line trastuzumab.  Patients were a mix of those having undergone gastrectomy and not.  OS was not significantly  different in the ITT population, but certain subpopulations showed significant differences.  In the subset of patients showing a stronger immunohistochemistry result for HER2 (IHC3+), progression free survival was significantly different at 5.6 months for lapatinib + pacitaxel vs. 4.2 months for pacitaxel alone.  The authors conclude that proof of concept for lapatanib addition to chemotherapy for certain subgroups is provided in this study.
316	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	ToGA, a Phase III study (NCT01041404) addressed use of trastuzumab in HER2 positive advanced gastric cancer, where chemotherapy using fluoropyrimidine-based and platinum-based combinations had been common practice.  Patients were given a chemotherapy regime containing capecitabine, flourouracil and cisplatin with (n=298) or without (n=296) trastuzumab, and had not been previously treated for metastatic cancer.  Study endpoint was overall survival, which was significantly different in the two populations (13.8 months with chemotherapy + trastuzumab and 11.1 months for chemotherapy alone).  The authors conclude that trastuzumab should be a standard option for HER2 positive advanced gastric cancer.
315	EREG	EXPRESSION	B	Panitumumab	Sensitivity/Response	"Prospectively planned retrospective biomarker study in archived tumor tissue from 323 patients from the PICCOLO trial (panitumumab plus irinotecan in CRC patients with KRAS wt). Tumors were classified as ""high expressor"" (either EREG or AREG mRNA level) or ""low expressor"" (neither EREG nor AREG in top tertile). For RAS wild-type patients with high ligand expression, median PFS was 8.3 [4.0-11.0] months (irinotecan with panitumumab) vs 4.4 [2.8-6.7] months (irinotecan alone); HR, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.24-0.61]; P < .001. In RAS wild-type patients with low ligand expression, median PFS was 3.2 [2.7-8.1] months (irinotecan with panitumumab) vs 4.0 [2.7-7.5] months (irinotecan); HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.64-1.37]; P = .73; interaction test results were significant [P = .01]). Results were less clear for response rate (interaction P = .17) and OS (interaction P = .11)."

1029	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Pertuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	The phase 2a MyPathway study assigned patients with HER2, EGFR, BRAF or SHH alterations to treatment with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, erlotinib, vemurafenib, or vismodegib, respectively. Two of nine patients (22%) with HER2 amplified/overexpressing pancreatic cancer had a PR with trastuzumab/pertuzumab combination. Another patient had SD > 120days.
1030	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	The phase 2a MyPathway study assigned patients with HER2, EGFR, BRAF or SHH alterations to treatment with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, erlotinib, vemurafenib, or vismodegib, respectively. Two of nine patients (22%) with HER2 amplified/overexpressing pancreatic cancer had a PR with trastuzumab/pertuzumab combination. Another patient had SD > 120days.

None of the 7 patients with HER2 amplified/overexpressing uterus cancer responded to pertuzumab/trastuzumab.
1032	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Pertuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	The phase 2a MyPathway study assigned patients with HER2, EGFR, BRAF or SHH alterations to treatment with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, erlotinib, vemurafenib, or vismodegib, respectively. None of the 7 patients with HER2 amplified/overexpressing uterus cancer responded to pertuzumab/trastuzumab.
309	MRE11	FRAMESHIFT	B	Olaparib	Sensitivity/Response	One patient in a cohort of 50 patients with metastatic prostate cancer had a frameshift mutation in the MRE11, ATM, MLH3 and NBN genes and showed clinical response to PARP inhibitor olaparib (16 weeks on Treatment).
308	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	Trastuzumab resistance is thought to consist of multiple compensatory mechanisms involving ErbB family members such as increased signaling through ErbB family heterodimers.  The irreversible TKI afatinib blocks EGFR, HER2, ErbB3 and ErbB4.  Thus afatinib was studied in this Phase I trial of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive metastatic BC (MBC) in combination with continued trastuzumab treatment, where trastuzumab is still the perferred treatment for trastuzumab-progressed MBC.  Objective response and disease control rates were 11% and 39%.  The authors conclude that the clinical activity observed in this trial warrants further work with afatinib and trastuzumab combination therapy.
307	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Afatinib	Sensitivity/Response	Trastuzumab resistance is thought to consist of multiple compensatory mechanisms involving ErbB family members such as increased signaling through ErbB family heterodimers.  The irreversible TKI afatinib blocks EGFR, HER2, ErbB3 and ErbB4.  Thus afatinib was studied in this Phase I trial of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive metastatic BC (MBC) in combination with continued trastuzumab treatment, where trastuzumab is still the perferred treatment for trastuzumab-progressed MBC.  Objective response and disease control rates were 11% and 39%.  The authors conclude that the clinical activity observed in this trial warrants further work with afatinib and trastuzumab combination therapy.
306	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Afatinib	Sensitivity/Response	LUX-Breast 1 is a phase 3 trial (NCT01125566) which enrolled 508 patients with metastatic HER2 positive BC who had progressed after adjuvant or first-line trastuzumab. It was thought that the wider range of ErbB family blocking and irreversible properties of afatinib could be beneficial in trastuzumab resistant cancer cells, since ErbB family members are thought to play a role in trastuzumab resistance. Primary endpoint was intention-to-treat group PFS. 339 patients were assigned to afatanib + vinorelbine and 169  to trastuzumab + vinorelbine.  Recruitment was stopped prematurely when it was deemed unlikely that the increased PFS would be seen in the afatinib group. Median PFS was 5.5 months in the afatinib group and 5.6 months in the trastuzumab group.  Afatanib plus vinorelbine was less well tolerated than trastuzumab plus vinorelbine, and the authors conclude that trastuzumab remains the best choice for treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive metastatic BC.
305	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Afatinib	Sensitivity/Response	This Phase II trial (LUX-Breast 3 - NCT01441596) compared afatinib, afatinib plus vinorelbine, or investigator's choice of treatment.  121 patients with HER2 overexpressing breast cancer with CNS recurrence or regression who had previously progressed on trastuzumab or lapatinib were assigned to 3 arms, with endpoint in the intention-to-treat population being patient benefit at 12 weeks defined as absence of CNS or extra CNS progression, no tumor related worsening of neurological symptoms and no increase in corticosteroid dose. Benefit was seen in 30% of 40 patients assigned to afatinib alone, 34.2% of 38 assigned to afatinib plus vinorelbine, and 41.9% of 43 assigned to investigator's treatment choice.  Differences were not statistically significant, and afatanib patients experienced more adverse effects.  While Afatanib did show response in HER2 breast cancer patients, it was not better than investigator's treatment choice and the investigators state that no further development of afatinib for HER2 breast cancer will be planned.
304	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Afatinib	Sensitivity/Response	With multiple mechanisms of HER reprogramming thought to be behind trastuzumab resistance, including increased expression of ErbB members, afatinib, which broadly and irreversibly targets ErbB receptors was tested in a single arm phase II trial on advanced stage HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer. From 41 treated patients, 10% had partial response, 37% had stable disease as best response and 46% achieved clinical benefit.  Median progression free survival (PFS) was 15.1 weeks and median overall survival (OS) was 61.0 weeks. The authors conclude that Afatinib monotherapy shows promise in treatment of metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer that has progressed under trastuzumab.
303	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Lapatinib	Sensitivity/Response	This Phase III study (EGF104900) was motivated by preclinical and other data demonstrating synergistic activity between lapatinib and trastuzumab against HER2 positive breast cancer (BC) cells.  In this study of HER2 positive metastatic BC which had progressed on trastuzumab, two arms were compared: lapatinib vs. lapatinib + trastuzumab. Progression free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. For 296 patients, 148 in each arm, median PFS of 8.1 weeks for lapatinib and 12.0 for combination therapy was observed (P=0.008).  The authors conclude that in the context of metastatic trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive BC, trastuzumab with lapatinib TKI addition is a favorable treatment.
302	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	This Phase III study (EGF104900) was motivated by preclinical and other data demonstrating synergistic activity between lapatinib and trastuzumab against HER2 positive breast cancer (BC) cells.  In this study of HER2 positive metastatic BC which had progressed on trastuzumab, two arms were compared: lapatinib vs. lapatinib + trastuzumab. Progression free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. For 296 patients, 148 in each arm, median PFS of 8.1 weeks for lapatinib and 12.0 for combination therapy was observed (P=0.008).  The authors conclude that in the context of metastatic trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive BC, trastuzumab with lapatinib TKI addition is a favorable treatment.
301	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Lapatinib	Sensitivity/Response	This Phase III trial compared the activity of lapatinib vs. trastuzumab vs. sequential trastuzumab followed by lapatinib vs. lapatinib plus trastuzumab in an adjuvant treatment setting.  8381 women were randomized to one of four treatment arms. Patients had HER2 positive non-metastatic operable BC. The primary endpoint was disease free survival.  First results report that after median 4.5 year follow up, a non significant 16% improvement in DFS was seen in trastuzumab + lapatinib vs. trastuzumab alone.  The results are interpreted as showing no added benefit for labatinib addition to trastuzumab in the adjuvant treatment context.  This trial is ongoing but not recruiting patients (NCT00490139).
300	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	This Phase III trial compared the activity of lapatinib vs. trastuzumab vs. sequential trastuzumab followed by lapatinib vs. lapatinib plus trastuzumab in an adjuvant treatment setting.  8381 women were randomized to one of four treatment arms. Patients had HER2 positive non-metastatic operable BC. The primary endpoint was disease free survival.  First results report that after median 4.5 year follow up, a non significant 16% improvement in DFS was seen in trastuzumab + lapatinib vs. trastuzumab alone.

299	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	In light of results showing increased PFS using mAB plus TKI in heavily pretreated patients, the efficacy of trastuzumab plus lapatinib in a neoadjuvant setting with untreated stage II or IIIA HER2 positive breast cancer was assessed.  In this randomized 3 arm phase II study (CHER-LOB), patients received (A) chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, (B) chemotherapy plus lapatinib, or (C) chemotherapy plus trastuzumab and lapatinib, with pathologic complete response (pCR) as endpoint.  From 121 patients, pCR rates were 25% in arm A, 26.3% in arm B, and 46.7% in arm C.  The authors conclude these results support the superiority of dual-HER2 inhibition in the neoadjuvant context of HER2 positive BC.
298	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Lapatinib	Sensitivity/Response	In light of results showing increased PFS using mAB plus TKI in heavily pretreated patients, the efficacy of trastuzumab plus lapatinib in a neoadjuvant setting with untreated stage II or IIIA HER2 positive breast cancer was assessed.

From 121 patients, pCR rates were 25% in arm A, 26.3% in arm B, and 46.7% in arm C.  The authors conclude these results support the superiority of dual-HER2 inhibition in the neoadjuvant context of HER2 positive BC.
295	BRAF	WILD TYPE	B	MEK Inhibitor RO4987655	Resistance	Phase I expansion and pharmacodynamic study of the oral MEK inhibitor RO4987655. Among 12 patients with melanoma BRAF wild type and non-NRAS or NRAS unknown status, seven patients experienced partial response (n=3) or stable disease (n=4). Authors conclude that RO4987655 has clinical activity in BRAF V600-wt (and BRAF V600E) melanoma. They suggest that other drugs such as immune check point inhibitors are preferred in BRAF wt melanoma, so the role of RO4987655 as a single agent is limited for BRAF WT patients with the possible exception of a small window of opportunity for combinations with MEK inhibitors after immunotherapy progression.
294	HLA-DRA	EXPRESSION	B	Pembrolizumab	Sensitivity/Response	Melanoma patients treated with Anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1(nivolumab, pembrolizumab, MPDL3280A) therapy were analyzed for expression of HLA-DRA (the primary antigen-presenting molecule of the MHC-II pathway). In a discovery cohort, 30 patients underwent IHC for HLA-DRA. 11/14 (79%) patients with positive HLA-DR staining, had complete (n=3) or partial (n=8) response. 6/16 (38%) HLA-DR non-expressing melanomas responded to therapy (overall response rate 79 versus 38%, Fisher’s exact test P=0.033). This finding was confirmed in a second independent data set of 23 melanoma patients with 6/8 (75%) of HLA-DR(+) tumours in comparison to 4/15 (27%) HLA-DR(−) responding (Fisher’s exact test P=0.025). Preclinical models confirmed the result.
293	HLA-DRA	EXPRESSION	B	Nivolumab	Sensitivity/Response	Melanoma patients treated with Anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1(nivolumab, pembrolizumab, MPDL3280A) therapy were analyzed for expression of HLA-DRA (the primary antigen-presenting molecule of the MHC-II pathway). In a discovery cohort, 30 patients underwent IHC for HLA-DRA. 11/14 (79%) patients with positive HLA-DR staining, had complete (n=3) or partial (n=8) response. 6/16 (38%) HLA-DR non-expressing melanomas responded to therapy (overall response rate 79 versus 38%, Fisher’s exact test P=0.033). This finding was confirmed in a second independent data set of 23 melanoma patients with 6/8 (75%) of HLA-DR(+) tumours in comparison to 4/15 (27%) HLA-DR(−) responding (Fisher’s exact test P=0.025). Preclinical models confirmed the result.
292	HLA-DRA	EXPRESSION	B	Atezolizumab	Sensitivity/Response	Melanoma patients treated with Anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1(nivolumab, pembrolizumab, MPDL3280A) therapy were analyzed for expression of HLA-DRA (the primary antigen-presenting molecule of the MHC-II pathway). In a discovery cohort, 30 patients underwent IHC for HLA-DRA. 11/14 (79%) patients with positive HLA-DR staining, had complete (n=3) or partial (n=8) response. 6/16 (38%) HLA-DR non-expressing melanomas responded to therapy (overall response rate 79 versus 38%, Fisher’s exact test P=0.033).

290	EGFR	AMPLIFICATION	B	Erlotinib	Sensitivity/Response	In 290 patients with advanced NSCLC, 177 of which were treated with EGFR TKI (erlotinib or gefitinib). EGFR amplification (Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification; MLPA) and Mutation (PCR) were analzed. EGFR amplification was associated with EGFR mutation but not independently with patient benefit from EGFR TKI (overall and progression-free survival).
289	EGFR	AMPLIFICATION	B	Gefitinib	Sensitivity/Response	In 290 patients with advanced NSCLC, 177 of which were treated with EGFR TKI (erlotinib or gefitinib). EGFR amplification (Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification; MLPA) and Mutation (PCR) were analzed. EGFR amplification was associated with EGFR mutation but not independently with patient benefit from EGFR TKI (overall and progression-free survival).
288	ERBB2	SERUM LEVELS	B	Lapatinib	Sensitivity/Response	Serum and tissue levels of HER2 (ERBB2) were analyzed in 1,902 breast cancer patients treated with lapatinib or control. Serum HER2 (sHER2) levels measured by ELISA were higher in patients with HER2 amplification (median sHER2 levels were 25.1 ng/mL in patients with HER2-positive tumors). Serum HER2 levels were Independent predictors of lapatinib progression free survival benefit (HR per 10-ng/mL increase in serum HER2: lapatinib-containing therapies, 1.009 v nonlapatinib-containing therapies, 1.044; P interaction < .001). Tissue HER2 levels were also predictive, but within this subgroup, serum HER2 still independently predicted lapatinib PFS benefit.
287	EGFR	VIII	B	Rindopepimut	Sensitivity/Response	In a Phase II clinical trial, patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), positive for EGFR VIII deletion mutation (N=65), were treated with the Rindopepimut cancer vaccine,  and standard adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy.  Median progression free survival (PFS) was 9.2 months, and median overall survival (OS) was 21.8 months.  A pivotal, randomized Phase III trial is currently underway.
285	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Afatinib	Sensitivity/Response	A phase II study involving adult female patients, >=18 years, with stage IIIB or IV HER2-positive (by IHC and/or in situ fluorescence) metastatic breast cancer. All patients were previously treated with trastuzumab and a median of three chemotherapy lines. 41 patients received 50 mg afatinib once-daily until disease progression and the primary endpoint was objective response rate. 4 patients (10% of 41 treated; 11% of evaluable patients) had partial response and 15 patients (37% of 41) had stable disease as best response. Thus a total of 19 (46% of 41) achieved clinical benefit. Median progression-free survival was 15.1 weeks.
1028	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	The phase 2a MyPathway study assigned patients with HER2, EGFR, BRAF or SHH alterations to treatment with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, erlotinib, vemurafenib, or vismodegib, respectively. Four of five patients with HER2 amplified/overexpressing salivary gland carcinoma (80%; 95% CI, 28% to > 99%) had responses (all PR).
1006	EGFR	AMPLIFICATION	B	Erlotinib	Sensitivity/Response	Among TKI-treated patients, increased EGFR gene copy number appears to be associated with improved survival outcomes.
1027	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Pertuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	The phase 2a MyPathway study assigned patients with HER2, EGFR, BRAF or SHH alterations to treatment with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, erlotinib, vemurafenib, or vismodegib, respectively. Four of five patients with HER2 amplified/overexpressing salivary gland carcinoma (80%; 95% CI, 28% to > 99%) had responses (all PR).
1026	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Pertuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	The phase 2a MyPathway study assigned patients with HER2, EGFR, BRAF or SHH alterations to treatment with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, erlotinib, vemurafenib, or vismodegib, respectively. Two of seven patients (29%; 95% CI, 4% to 71%) with biliary cancer and HER2 amplification/overexpression had PR, and three had SD > 120 days
356	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Capecitabine	Sensitivity/Response	In this Phase III trial, trastuzumab-based treatment was assessed in women with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who had progressed on trastuzumab.  Patients had 12 weeks or greater previous trastuzumab treatment with time since end of last cycle less than 6 weeks.  Primary endpoint was time to progression.  78 patients were assigned to each group, with median time to progression of 5.6 months in capecitabine group and 8.2 months in trastuzumab plus capecitabine group.  The results are in contrast to the principle of change of treatment on disease progression, and authors suggest that chemotherapy-sensitizing mechanisms of trastuzumab remain intact in HER2 breast cancer cells with trastuzumab progression.
355	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	In this Phase III trial, trastuzumab-based treatment was assessed in women with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who had progressed on trastuzumab.  Patients had 12 weeks or greater previous trastuzumab treatment with time since end of last cycle less than 6 weeks.  Primary endpoint was time to progression.  78 patients were assigned to each group, with median time to progression of 5.6 months in capecitabine group and 8.2 months in trastuzumab plus capecitabine group.

354	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Capecitabine	Sensitivity/Response	This Phase III trial took patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 (ERBB2) positive breast cancer that had progressed on prior trastuzumab treatment.  Patients were given capecitabine (n=161) or lapatinib plus capecitabine (n=163). The primary endpoint of the study was time to progression. Median time to progression was 4.4 months in the capecitabine group and 8.4 months in capecitabine plus lapatinib group (hazard ratio was 0.49 ; 95% confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.71; P<0.001).  The results indicated that lapatinib may be useful in addressing the problem of trastuzumab progression in HER2 breast cancer.

The results indicated that lapatinib may be useful in addressing the problem of trastuzumab progression in HER2 breast cancer.
352	PTEN	EXPRESSION	B	Gefitinib	Sensitivity/Response	Expression of EGFRvIII and PTEN was evaluated in 26 patients with glioblastomas treated with erlotinib or gefitinib and no EGFR or Her2/neu kinase domain mutations. 7 patients responded to treatment while 19 progressed rapidly. Coexpression of EGFRvIII and PTEN was associated with clinical response (defined as 25% tumor shrinkage). These results were confirmed using IHC in an independent cohort of 33 patients (8 responders) treated with erlotinib at another institution.

968	CDK4	AMPLIFICATION	B	Palbociclib	Sensitivity/Response	A total of 59 patients with well-differentiated or dedifferentiated liposarcomas were enrolled in a phase 2 study to evaluate palbociclib efficacy. Half of the patients had received prior treatment and half were treatment naive. Of the 59 patients, at least 34 conferred CDK4 amplification and the remaining were not tested for CDK4 amplification. In the initial cohort (n=28), where all patients had confirmed CDK4 amplification, at least 14 of the patients were progression free at 12 weeks. Overall progression-free survival at 12 weeks was 57.2% and overall median PFS was 17.9 weeks. There was 1 complete response. Toxic effects were primarily hematologic and included neutropenia (grade 3, n = 20 [33%]; grade 4, n = 2 [3%]) but no neutropenic fever.
1012	ERBB2	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Capecitabine	Sensitivity/Response	This is Phase II trial of Trastuzumab and capecitabine as first line treatment in patients with IHC 3+ HER2 expressing advanced pancreatic cancer or cancer with HER2 gene amplification of stage IVB. Total 207 patients could be assessed for HER2 expression. From the 23 patient with IHC 3+ HER2 expression or IHC 2+ and HER2 gene amplification, 17 patients were included in the study and could be assessed for response to the treatment. Contrary to breast and gastric cancer, only 7 out of 11 (64%) patients with IHC 3+ HER2 expression showed gene amplification. PFS rate at 12 weeks was estimated as 23.5%. Median PFS was 65 days. Median OS was 6.9 months. Authors concluded not to recommend further evaluation of anti-HER2 treatment in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

343	FLT3	ITD	B	Anthracycline Antineoplastic Antibiotic	Resistance	In a study of 171 APL patients treated with combination ATRA/anthracycline chemotherapy, FLT3 ITD mutations (n=35) were associated with lower 3-year OS compared to the FLT3 ITD-negative group (62% vs. 82%), as well as higher CR achievement failure and early death.
342	FLT3	ITD	B	Tretinoin	Resistance	In a study of 171 APL patients treated with combination ATRA/anthracycline chemotherapy, FLT3 ITD mutations (n=35) were associated with lower 3-year OS compared to the FLT3 ITD-negative group (62% vs. 82%), as well as higher CR achievement failure and early death.
1014	ERBB2	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with IHC 2+/3+ HER2 received gemcitabine and Trastuzumab combination. Screening logs demonstrated the rate of HER2 overexpression was 16%. Thirty-four patients were enrolled. Thirty patients (88%) had pancreatic cancers with 2+ overexpression and 4 patients (12%) had 3+ overexpression. Confirmed partial responses were observed in 2 of 32 patients (6%). The median survival for all 34 patients was 7 months.

332	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	CLEOPATRA (NCT00567190) was a Phase III, randomized and double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 808 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.  Patients were HER2-positive by IHC3+ or FISH, and patients who had received prior hormonal treatment or adjuvant/neo-adjuvant therapy with or without trastuzumab for longer than 12 months before randomization were also eligible.  The two arms of the study were trastuzumab and docetaxel with either placebo or pertuzumab.  Median PFS in the placebo arm was 12.4 months while in the petuzumab arm 18.5 months was achieved.  Median OS in the control arm was 40.8 months and 56.5 months with pertuzumab.  These strong results make a case for dual antibody blockade in first line treatments of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.
331	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Pertuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	CLEOPATRA (NCT00567190) was a Phase III, randomized and double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 808 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.

These strong results make a case for dual antibody blockade in first line treatments of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.
1021	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	The phase 2a MyPathway study assigned patients with HER2, EGFR, BRAF or SHH alterations to treatment with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, erlotinib, vemurafenib, or vismodegib, respectively.  Thirty of 114 patients (26%; 95% CI, 19% to 35%) with HER2 amplification/overexpression had objective responses to treatment with trastuzumab plus pertuzumab (two CR, 28 PR).  Patients with HER2-amplified/overexpressing metastatic colorectal cancer composed the largest tumor-pathway cohort. In this group of 37 patients with refractory disease (median, four previous lines of therapy), treatment with trastuzumab plus pertuzumab produced PRs in 14 patients (38%; 95% CI, 23% to 55%; Fig 2A). An additional four patients had SD > 120 days. The median DOR was 11 months (range, < 1 to 16+ months; 95% CI, 2.8 months to not estimable).
1022	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Pertuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	The phase 2a MyPathway study assigned patients with HER2, EGFR, BRAF or SHH alterations to treatment with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, erlotinib, vemurafenib, or vismodegib, respectively.  Thirty of 114 patients (26%; 95% CI, 19% to 35%) with HER2 amplification/overexpression had objective responses to treatment with trastuzumab plus pertuzumab (two CR, 28 PR).  Patients with HER2-amplified/overexpressing metastatic colorectal cancer composed the largest tumor-pathway cohort. In this group of 37 patients with refractory disease (median, four previous lines of therapy), treatment with trastuzumab plus pertuzumab produced PRs in 14 patients (38%; 95% CI, 23% to 55%; Fig 2A). An additional four patients had SD > 120 days. The median DOR was 11 months (range, < 1 to 16+ months; 95% CI, 2.8 months to not estimable).
1023	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	The phase 2a MyPathway study assigned patients with HER2, EGFR, BRAF or SHH alterations to treatment with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, erlotinib, vemurafenib, or vismodegib, respectively. Three of nine patients (33%; 95% CI, 8% to 70%) with advanced bladder cancer and HER2 amplification/overexpression had responses (one CR ongoing at 15 months; two PR lasting 1 and 6 months), and two patients had SD > 120 days.
1024	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Pertuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	The phase 2a MyPathway study assigned patients with HER2, EGFR, BRAF or SHH alterations to treatment with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, erlotinib, vemurafenib, or vismodegib, respectively. Three of nine patients (33%; 95% CI, 8% to 70%) with advanced bladder cancer and HER2 amplification/overexpression had responses (one CR ongoing at 15 months; two PR lasting 1 and 6 months), and two patients had SD > 120 days.
1025	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	The phase 2a MyPathway study assigned patients with HER2, EGFR, BRAF or SHH alterations to treatment with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, erlotinib, vemurafenib, or vismodegib, respectively. Two of seven patients (29%; 95% CI, 4% to 71%) with biliary cancer and HER2 amplification/overexpression had PR, and three had SD > 120 days
324	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	In this phase II trial a small group of patients with IHC2+ or IHC3+ HER2 NSCLC, in which primary platinum-based therapy had failed, were given either docetaxel or trastuzumab after which both groups were given docetaxel and trastuzumab together.  there was one partial response in the docetaxel group and none in the trastuzumab group.  The authors report that due to the limited clinical activity of trastuzumab-based therapy in this cohort, as well as similar results in other trastuzumab studies, that targets other than HER2 in NSCLC should be considered for future study.  This 2004 study remains cited in 2016 literature in discussing the unclear efficacy of trastuzumab in wild-type HER2 overexpressing NSCLC, but mutant HER2 in NSCLC has been further studied and a picture of different HER2 mutations being potentially responsive to specific targeted therapies is emerging.
323	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	In this phase II trial with 2 arms, 103 patients with untreated stage IIIB/IV HER2 positive NSCLC were given gemcitabine-cisplatin with or without trastuzumab.  HER2 positivity was broadly defined as IHC2+/3+, positive by FISH, or increased circulating HER2 extracellular domain.  Significant differences between the treatment arms were not observed, but in a small subset of IHC3+/FISH positive patients, 5 of 6 responded to trastuzumab and had increased PFS of 8.5 months in comparison to 6.1 months in the IHC2+ group.  Although from 2004, this study remains cited in 2016 literature when discussing the unclear efficacy of trastuzumab in wild-type HER2 overexpressing NSCLC. The authors conclude that future studies of trastuzumab in HER2 positive NSCLC should focus on high expressing subjects.
322	FLT3	ITD	B	Sorafenib	Sensitivity/Response	13 patients with relapsed or chemo-refractory FLT3-ITD+ AML were treated with sorafenib (200-400 mg twice daily). 12 patients showed clearance or near clearance of bone marrow myeloblasts after 27 (range 21-84) days with evidence of differentiation of leukemia cells. Sorafenib response was lost in most patients after 72 (range 54-287) days.
320	ROS1	REARRANGEMENT	B	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	In a retrospective study, 30 patients were evaluated after crizotinib treatment for stage IV NSCLC confirmed for ROS1 rearrangement. On crizotinib, 24 of the patients achieved objective responses including 5 complete responses. Median progression free survival was 9.1 months and all patients had  been pretreated with 1 or more lines of chemotherapy.
967	ERBB2	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Trastuzumab Emtansine	Sensitivity/Response	Trastuzumab emtansine has its indication for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer after therapy with Trastuzumab and Taxane, approval based on PFS and preliminary OS data. EMILIA was a randomised open-label, phase III study for patients with HER2-positive, unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with Trastuzumab and a Taxane, randomized 1:1 to Trastuzumab-emtansine or Capecitabine plus Lapatinib. 991 patients were enrolled. Median OS was 29.9m vs. 25.9m. Fewer grade 3 or worse AE occurred with trastuzumab emtansine than with capecitabine plus lapatinib control treatment.
946	ABL1	BCR::ABL F486S	B	Dasatinib	Resistance	This is a retrospective study of imatinib-resistant (n = 805) or -intolerant (n = 238), chronic myeloid leukemia (chronic-phase), patients with mutations in the BCR-ABL gene fusion kinase domain from the START-C, START-R, and CA180-034 trials. With dasatinib monotherapy, patients with and without ABL1 mutation had comparable complete hematologic response (CHR), major cytogenetic response (MCyR), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), and major molecular response (MMR). Out of 13 patients with F486S mutations, 5, 6, and 12 achieved CCyR, MCyR, and CHR with dasatinib monotherapy, respectively. Analyses by variant included patients with multiple kinase domain mutations.
965	BRCA1	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	B	Talazoparib	Sensitivity/Response	In part 2 of a two-part dose-escalation phase I trial (NCT01286987), 71 patients with Ewings sarcoma, breast, ovarian, small cell lung, or pancreatic cancers received 1.0 mg/day talazoparib treatment. Of patients with BRCA mutation-associated breast and ovarian cancers, confirmed responses were observed in 7 of 14 (50%) and 5 of 12 (42%) patients, respectively.
780	TP53	ALTERATION	B	Carboplatin	Resistance	In a group of patients with invasive ovarian carcinoma who had undergone surgery, a subset of 74 patients treated with platinum based chemotherapy were assessed for  p53 alteration (p53 mutation or p53 overexpression by immunostaining >10% positive). Significant decreased time to progression (p=0.037) was seen in the subset of  patients with p53 alteration (n=54) in comparison to the group with normatl p53 (n=20)
781	TP53	DNA BINDING DOMAIN MUTATION	B	Tamoxifen	Resistance	In a study 202 breast cancer patients undergoing first line tamoxifen treatment, 65 patients had mutations in TP53. Among the p53 wild type population a 66% response rate was reported, where response was considered as complete response, partial response or stable disease. In a patient subgroup with mutations in p53 amino acids that directly interact with DNA, 2 of 11 (18%) of patients responded to tamoxifen.
782	TP53	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Cisplatin	Sensitivity/Response	In a Phase II trial of 25 patients with metastaic gastric cancer, patients received preoperative high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) consisting of etoposide, cisplatin and mitomycin. Patients with greater than 50% regression in response to HDCT received surgery. TP53 overexpression was assayed by immunohistochemistry. 14 patients showed p53 overexpression, and 12 of these qualified for resection. Overall survival in patients with p53 overexpression was 17.3 months in contrast to patients with negative p53 immunohistochemistry, where it was 7.2 months (p=0.0003).
783	TP53	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Mitomycin	Sensitivity/Response	In a Phase II trial of 25 patients with metastaic gastric cancer, patients received preoperative high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) consisting of etoposide, cisplatin and mitomycin. Patients with greater than 50% regression in response to HDCT received surgery. TP53 overexpression was assayed by immunohistochemistry. 14 patients showed p53 overexpression, and 12 of these qualified for resection. Overall survival in patients with p53 overexpression was 17.3 months in contrast to patients with negative p53 immunohistochemistry, where it was 7.2 months (p=0.0003).
784	TP53	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Etoposide	Sensitivity/Response	In a Phase II trial of 25 patients with metastaic gastric cancer, patients received preoperative high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) consisting of etoposide, cisplatin and mitomycin. Patients with greater than 50% regression in response to HDCT received surgery. TP53 overexpression was assayed by immunohistochemistry. 14 patients showed p53 overexpression, and 12 of these qualified for resection. Overall survival in patients with p53 overexpression was 17.3 months in contrast to patients with negative p53 immunohistochemistry, where it was 7.2 months (p=0.0003).
797	MGMT	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Temozolomide	Sensitivity/Response	In this study, patients with low MGMT expression, compared with patients with high MGMT expression, had a significantly higher response rate (55% v 7%, respectively; P = .004) and improved PFS (median, 5.5 v 1.9 months, respectively; P = .009) and OS (median, 16 v 5 months, respectively; P = .003). Among patients with MGMT data available for analysis, radiotherapy was started and completed in 91% of patients with low MGMT expression. In contrast, among patients with high MGMT expression, only 64% started radiotherapy, and 43% completed it. These results suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be feasible for inoperable glioblastoma patients expressing low levels of MGMT without compromising subsequent treatment with radiotherapy, whereas patients with high MGMT expression are less likely to respond and more likely to experience progression before or during radiotherapy.
798	MGMT	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Temozolomide	Sensitivity/Response	This study showed that low MGMT mRNA expression was strongly predictive for prolonged time to progression, treatment response, and length of survival in univariate and multivariate models (p<0.0001). The degree of MGMT mRNA expression was highly correlated with the MGMT promoter methylation status (p<0.0001); however, discordant findings were seen in 12 glioblastoma patients. Patients with methylated tumors with high MGMT mRNA expression (N = 6) did significantly worse than those with low transcriptional activity (p<0.01). Conversely, unmethylated tumors with low MGMT mRNA expression (N = 6) did better than their counterparts.
799	MGMT	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Temozolomide	Sensitivity/Response	In this study, loss of chromosome 1p and low MGMT protein expression were associated with objective response (P < .003 and P < .04, respectively). However, only 54% of the study group had evaluation of 1p/19q status, and MGMT protein expression was studied in only 33%. Therefore, the association between 1p deletion and low MGMT protein expression was statistically significant when evaluated further and verified in the extended group of 31 patients with low-grade oligodendrogliomas.
800	MGMT	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Temozolomide	Sensitivity/Response	In 41 glioblastomas treated with temozolomide (TMZ) therapy (MGMT-immunopositive: n = 22, negative: n = 19), both progression free survival and overall survival were significantly better in MGMT-immunonegative glioblastomas. (PFS: P = 0.0015, OS: P = 0.0384).
593	CD274	EXPRESSION	B	Nivolumab	Sensitivity/Response	A clinical trial of 86 patients evaluated concurrent (n=53) or sequential (n=33) treatment of ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4) and nivolumab (anti-PD1). In the concurrent regimen cohort, 65% of patients showed clinical activity with no correlation between PD-L1 expression and response (6 of 13 patients were PD-L1 positive versus 9 of 22 patients were PD-L1 negative). In the sequential regimen cohort, 20% of patients had an objective response with a potential correlation between PD-L1 expression and response (4 of 8 patients were PD-L1 positive versus 1 of 13 patients were PD-L1 negative).
592	CD274	EXPRESSION	B	Ipilimumab	Sensitivity/Response	A clinical trial of 86 patients evaluated concurrent (n=53) or sequential (n=33) treatment of ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4) and nivolumab (anti-PD1). In the concurrent regimen cohort, 65% of patients showed clinical activity with no correlation between PD-L1 expression and response (6 of 13 patients were PD-L1 positive versus 9 of 22 patients were PD-L1 negative). In the sequential regimen cohort, 20% of patients had an objective response with a potential correlation between PD-L1 expression and response (4 of 8 patients were PD-L1 positive versus 1 of 13 patients were PD-L1 negative).
801	MGMT	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Temozolomide	Sensitivity/Response	Among those patients who received temozolomide-based therapy in this study, the median progression-free survival for patients whose tumors showed intact MGMT expression was 9.3 months compared with 19.2 months for patients with MGMT-deficient tumors (P = 0.11). The median overall survival for patients whose tumors showed intact MGMT expression was 19.1 months; the median overall survival for patients with MGMT deficient tumors was not reached.
802	RRM1	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Gemcitabine	Sensitivity/Response	In the personalized therapy group of this study, patients received chemotherapy based on RRM-1 IHC expression levels, whereas the standard therapy group received non-customized chemotherapy. There were statistically significant improvements between the personalized therapy group versus the standard therapy group in disease control rate (82.9% vs 55.3%, P=0.004), and progression-free survival (median: 5.5 months vs 3.0 months, P=0.005). Besides, the overall survival had a tendency to become more prolonged (median: 16.0 months vs 12.4 months, P=0.286).
779	TP53	ALTERATION	B	Cisplatin	Resistance	In a group of patients with invasive ovarian carcinoma who had undergone surgery, a subset of 74 patients treated with platinum based chemotherapy were assessed for  p53 alteration (p53 mutation or p53 overexpression by immunostaining >10% positive). Significant decreased time to progression (p=0.037) was seen in the subset of  patients with p53 alteration (n=54) in comparison to the group with normatl p53 (n=20)
803	RRM1	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Cisplatin	Sensitivity/Response	In the personalized therapy group of this study, patients received chemotherapy based on RRM-1 IHC expression levels, whereas the standard therapy group received non-customized chemotherapy. There were statistically significant improvements between the personalized therapy group versus the standard therapy group in disease control rate (82.9% vs 55.3%, P=0.004), and progression-free survival (median: 5.5 months vs 3.0 months, P=0.005). Besides, the overall survival had a tendency to become more prolonged (median: 16.0 months vs 12.4 months, P=0.286).
586	FGF3	AMPLIFICATION	B	Dovitinib	Sensitivity/Response	81 patients were enrolled in a clinical trial with the FGFR inhibitor dovitinib. Four of these patients had FGF3 amplifications (qPCR) and showed tumor reductions of 100%, 30.8%, 23.0%, and 7.5%, respectively. 3 of these 4 patients also had FGFR1 amplifications (≥6 copies by qPCR) and the fourth presented with FGFR1-gene gain (3.4 copies of FGFR1 by qPCR and SISH negative).
585	FGFR2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Dovitinib	Sensitivity/Response	Dovitinib was evaluated in-vitro, in xenograft and in a phase 2 study. Dovitinib inhibited proliferation in one FGFR1- and one FGFR2-amplified breast cancer cell lines at higher IC50 values than in 11 nonamplified cell lines. Dovitinib inhibited tumor growth and caused regression in both a FGFR1- and FGFR2-amplified xenograft model. 81 patients were enrolled in the trial and treated with dovitinib. 2 patients were reported to harbor FGFR2 amplifications and both had a reduction in tumor size of 18.5 and 28.2%, respectively. When FGFR1, FGF3 and FGFR2 amplifications were combined, a combined FGF-pathway amplified patient group had a higher mean reduction in target lesion size than patients with FGF-non-amplified tumors.
584	FGFR1	AMPLIFICATION	B	Dovitinib	Sensitivity/Response	Dovitinib was evaluated in-vitro, in xenograft and in a phase 2 study. Dovitinib inhibited proliferation in one FGFR1- and one FGFR2-amplified breast cancer cell lines at higher IC50 values than in 11 nonamplified cell lines. Dovitinib inhibited tumor growth and caused regression in both a FGFR1- and FGFR2-amplified xenograft model. 81 patients were enrolled in the trial and treated with dovitinib. Unconfirmed response or stable disease >6 months was observed in 25% of FGFR1-amplified/HR-positive vs. 3% FGFR1-nonamplified/HR-positive breast cancer patientes. When FGF3 and FGFR2 amplifications were also assessed, a combined FGF-pathway amplified patient group had a higher mean reduction in target lesion size than patients with FGF-non-amplified tumors.
810	CTAG1B	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Letetresgene Autoleucel	Sensitivity/Response	Clinical responses to NY-ESO-1/LAGE-1 TCR-engineered T-cells were observed in 16 of 20 patients (80%) with advanced multiple myeloma expressing NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1 in this Phase 1/2a trial showing a median progression free survival of 19.1 months.
811	CTAG2	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Letetresgene Autoleucel	Sensitivity/Response	Clinical responses to NY-ESO-1/LAGE-1 TCR-engineered T-cells were observed in 16 of 20 patients (80%) with advanced multiple myeloma expressing NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1 in this Phase 1/2a trial showing a median progression free survival of 19.1 months.
813	NTRK1	FUSION	B	Entrectinib	Sensitivity/Response	in two phase I studies in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including patients with active central nervous system (CNS) disease. Here, we summarize the overall safety and report the antitumor activity of entrectinib in a cohort of patients with tumors harboring NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, or ALK gene fusions Responses were observed in non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, mammary analogue secretory carcinoma, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma, as early as 4 weeks after starting treatment and lasting as long as >2 years. Notably, a complete CNS response was achieved in a patient with SQSTM1-NTRK1-rearranged lung cancer.
578	MET	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Vemurafenib	Resistance	FFPE tumours from patients enrolled in the BRIM2 (n = 59) and BRIM3 (n = 150) trials of vemurafenib in advanced BRAF mutant (V600E/K) melanoma were analyzed for MET expression (IHC). Pretreatment MET expression was frequent at the ≥1 + cutoff (BRIM3, 31%; BRIM2, 49%), but relatively infrequent at the ≥2 + cutoff (BRIM3, 9%; BRIM2, 19%). Retrospective subset analyses showed that, irrespective of the cutoff used or the treatment arm, MET expression did not show prognostic significance, in terms of objective response rate, progression-free survival, or overall survival.
814	NTRK3	FUSION	B	Entrectinib	Sensitivity/Response	in two phase I studies in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including patients with active central nervous system (CNS) disease. Here, we summarize the overall safety and report the antitumor activity of entrectinib in a cohort of patients with tumors harboring NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, or ALK gene fusions Responses were observed in non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, mammary analogue secretory carcinoma, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma, as early as 4 weeks after starting treatment and lasting as long as >2 years. Notably, a complete CNS response was achieved in a patient with SQSTM1-NTRK1-rearranged lung cancer.
576	MET	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Vemurafenib	Resistance	Whole exome sequencing, transcriptome and methylome alterations in 48 melanoma samples with acquired resistance to BRAFi +/- MEKi therapy compared to patient-matched baseline melanoma tissues were analyzed. 39% of resistant melanomas were not accounted for by any validated mutational mechanism. c-MET was overexpressed in 21 of 48 (44%) resistant samples. Methylome analysis revealed three CpG clusters (C1–3) with differential methylation to be negatively correlated with differential c-MET mRNA expression. In nearly all (90%) pairwise comparisons of tumors and cell lines, differential c-MET mRNA expression could be accounted for by at least one differential CpG cluster methylation (Δβ ≥ 10% and FDR adjusted p ≤ 0.05). In contrast, only 48% displayed a concordant differential expression pattern of at least one c-MET transcription factor. In an independent study, c-MET was overexpressed in 8 of 35 (23%) MAPKi-resistant tumors from 7 of 26 (27%) patients. In two human BRAF V600E mutant cell lines, BRAFi treatment led to progressive methylation-expression changes akin to observations across MAPKi-sensitive versus resistant tumors.
575	CD274	EXPRESSION	B	Pembrolizumab	Sensitivity/Response	Patients with Merkel Cell Carcinoma (n=26) were enrolled to receive pembrolizumab. Of these patients, 25 were evaluated for response rate to pembrolizumab and PD-L1 (CD274) expression. The response rate to pembrolizumab was 56% (95%CI: 35-76%), however, there was no correlation between PD-L1 expression (cutoff >1%) on tumor cells or on infiltrating immune cells and clinical response to pembrolizumab (P=0.61).
574	ALK	FUSION	B	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	A phase-3 clinical trial evaluated 347 patients with ALK-positive lung cancer.  The study compared crizotinib treatment (n=173) with chemotherapy treatment of either pemetrexed or docetaxel (n=174).  In the crizotinib arm, the response rate was significantly higher (65% vs 20%; P<0.001), the progression-free survival was increased (7.7 months vs. 3.0 months; HR=0.49, 95%CI:14 months-26 months; p<0.001), however, there was no significant improvement in overall survival (HR=1.02; 95%CI:0.68-1.54; P=0.54).  Of the patients on crizotinib treatment, global quality of life was improved relative to baseline when compared to chemotherapy patients (+5 mean change, -5 mean change; P<0.001).
573	EGFR	EXPRESSION	B	Cetuximab	Sensitivity/Response	Patients with refractory colorectal cancer expressing immunohistochemically detectable EGFR were randomly assigned to receive treatment with cetuximab (n=287) or receive supportive care alone (n=285). Patients receiving cetuximab had increased overall survival (HR=0.77, 95%CI 0.64-0.92; p=0.005), increased progression-free survival (HR=0.68, 95%CI 0.57-0.80; p<0.001), and improved quality of life at 4 months measured by survey on physical deterioration (-5.9 vs -12.5; p=0.03) and global health status (-3.6 vs. -15.2; p<0.001).
815	ROS1	REARRANGEMENT	B	Entrectinib	Sensitivity/Response	Two phase I studies included 119 patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, which included 28 patients with ROS1 rearrangements (n=28) where the overall safety and antitumor activity of entrectinib was examined. Entrectinib was shown to be safe and well tolerated. For phase 2, 14 ROS1-rearranged solid tumors were eligible and demonstrated an overall objective response rate of 86% (95% CI: 60–96) to entrectinib. Of the 14, 13 were Non-small cell lung cancer cases, 12 of which showed response with 2 of these patients demonstrated a complete response. A single melanoma case with a ROS1 rearrangement also showed a response to treatment.
587	RB1	PHOSPHORYLATION	B	Alpelisib	Resistance	The p110alpha-specific PI3K inhibitor BYL719 (Alpelisib) was used on a panel of five PI3K inhibitor sensitive and five resistant breast cancer cell lines. Sensitive cells (IC50<400nM) showed reduced phospho-Rb (p-Rb) western blot levels in response to BYL719 treatment, while resistant cell lines (IC50>800nM) showed significantly less reduction in p-Rb after BYL719. Paired biopsies before and after treatment were taken from a set of eight patients classified as either responder or non-responder to BYL719. Responder samples showed significantly reduced p-Rb staining after treatment in comparison to non-responder biopsies. In biopsies taken from a group of three responders who progressed, p-Rb levels were increased after progression.
607	SMAD4	DELETION	B	Fluorouracil	Resistance	A retrospective study with 202 colorectal cancer patients found that SMAD4 deletion was associated with worse outcomes during 5-fluorouracil treatment. The hazard ratio for disease-free survival was 2.89 times greater for patients with SMAD4 deletion as compared to those  with normal SMAD4 diploidy (P = .045).  For overall survival, the hazard ratio was 3.23 times greater for SMAD4 deletion (P = .056).
608	ATRX	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Temozolomide	Sensitivity/Response	A retrospective tumor sample study found that the loss of ATRX expression (less than 10% of nuclei) in IDH-mutant astrocytomas treated with temozolomide or a combination of procarbazine, lomustine and vincristine (PCV) was associated with better outcomes. Patients with IDH-mutant tumors and ATRX expression loss (n=40) experienced greater time to treatment failure (55.6 months vs. 31.8 months; P = 0.0168) and a greater progression-free survival (37.1 months vs. 18.1 months; P = 0.038) compared to patients with IDH-mutant tumors with ATRX expression (n=9).
609	ATRX	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	PCV Regimen	Sensitivity/Response	A retrospective tumor sample study found that the loss of ATRX expression (less than 10% of nuclei) in IDH-mutant astrocytomas treated with temozolomide or a combination of procarbazine, lomustine and vincristine (PCV) was associated with better outcomes. Patients with IDH-mutant tumors and ATRX expression loss (n=40) experienced greater time to treatment failure (55.6 months vs. 31.8 months; P = 0.0168) and a greater progression-free survival (37.1 months vs. 18.1 months; P = 0.038) compared to patients with IDH-mutant tumors with ATRX expression (n=9).
683	FGFR1	AMPLIFICATION	B	Infigratinib	Sensitivity/Response	Phase 1 study of FGFR-inhibitor BGJ398 (infigratinib) in advanced cancer with FGFR-aberrations (n=132). In the subgroup of FGFR1-amplified squamous NSCLC (as classified by FISH), 36 patients were treated at doses >100mg continuously and disease control was achieved in 50% of patients (4 PR and 14 SD) with 6 patients receiving treatment after 16 weeks. Of the 27 patients who had evaluable pre- and post- treatment target lesion assessments, 11 had reduced tumor burden.
684	FGFR1	AMPLIFICATION	B	Infigratinib	Resistance	Phase 1 study of FGFR-inhibitor BGJ398 (infigratinib) in advanced cancer with FGFR-aberrations (n=132). Among the 21 continuously treated (>100mg) patients with breast cancer and FGFR1 amplification (as classified by FISH), 9 had a best response of SD, three of which experienced reductions in tumor burden.
687	FGFR2	FUSION	B	Erdafitinib	Sensitivity/Response	Phase 1 study of pan-FGFR inhibitor JNJ-42756493 in patients with solid tumors. No responses were seen 36 patients without FGFR pathway aberrations. Among 23 patients with FGFR pathway aberrations, 4 partial responses as well as 16 with stable disease were seen. In patients with FGFR2 fusions, 1 patient with urothelial cancer had a PR harbored FGFR2-BICC1/FGFR2-CASP7 fusions, a patient with endometrial cancer and synchronous FGFR3-TACC3 and FGFR2-BICC1/FGFR2-OFD1 fusions had a PR, and tumor shrinkage was observed in a patient with adrenal carcinoma and FGFR3-TACC3/FGFR2-CCDC6 fusions.
657	UGT1A1	UGT1A1*60	B	Belinostat	Adverse Response	In a phase 1 trial belinostat (400-800mg/m2/24h) was administered to 25 patients in combination with cisplatin and etoposide. Endpoints were associations between genotype of UGT1A1 and pharmacokinetics, toxicities and proteine lysine acetylation. Belinostat AUC and half-life was significantly increased in UGT1A1*60 carriers, and they were at greater risk for thrombocytopenia.
701	EGFR	EXPRESSION	B	Lapatinib	Sensitivity/Response	18 advanced progressing chordoma patients that were positive for EGFR by at least one technique (immunohistochemistry and/or phospho-arrays, real-time polymerase chain reaction for EGFR ligands, FISH) entered this phase 2 study investigating the efficacy of lapatinib (median age: 61 years; disease extent: metastatic 72% and locally advanced 28%). Of the 25 patients screened, three tested negative for EGFR. Six (33.3%) patients had PR and 7 (38.9%) SD, as their best Choi responses, corresponding to RECIST SD in all cases. Median PFS by Choi was 6 [interquartile (IQ) range 3-8] months. Median PFS by RECIST was 8 (IQ range 4-12) months, with a 22% CBR. This phase II study showed a modest antitumor activity of lapatinib in chordoma
702	FGFR2	AMPLIFICATION	B	FGFR Inhibitor AZD4547	Sensitivity/Response	Nine patients with FGFR2-amplified gastroesophageal cancer were treated with AZD4547.  Of these 9 patients, 3 showed confirmed responses to AZD4547. Median progression-free survival was 6.6 months (range=6.2-10.5). Two additional patients had a response in day 15 using FDG-PET but were not considered complete responders by RECIST criteria. High-level FGFR2-amplified (arbitrarily defined as FISH-ratio > 5) cancers had a higher likelihood of response and were associated with a substantially higher expression of both FGFR2 mRNA and FGFR2 protein (IHC). In vitro and in PDX models, FGFR2-amplified cell lines were sensitive to FGFR inhibition. Further preclinical analyses suggested, that FGFR2 amplification mainly signals via the PI3K pathway.
650	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Trastuzumab Emtansine	Sensitivity/Response	In the single arm Phase II study (TDM4258g) breast cancer patients who had progressed on previous anti-HER2 therapy were given transtuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), a HER2 monoclonal antibody and antimicrotubule drug conjugate. 95 trial participants with archival primary tumor were reassessed for HER2 status (positivity defined by FISH or IHC 3+), and 74 patients were confirmed for HER2 positivity and 21 were normal. Overall response rate was 33.8% (95% CI, 23.2% to 44.9%) in patients with confirmed HER2-positive tumors and 4.8% (95% CI, 1.0% to 21.8%) in HER2 normal patients. Median PFS was 8.2 months (95% CI, 4.4 months to not estimable) in patients with confirmed HER2-positive tumors and 2.6 months (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9 months) in HER2 normal patients.
705	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Cetuximab	Resistance	We identified 142 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer whose tumors harbored both wild-type exons 2, 3, and 4 in KRAS and NRAS, and wild-type exon 15 in BRAF. All patients received cetuximab after oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and fluoropyrimidine failure. HER2 status was determined using immunohistochemistry and silver in situ hybridization and correlated with cetuximab efficacy. Of 142 RAS and BRAF wild-type tumors, we observed 7 cases (4.9%) of HER2 amplification by SISH. After a median follow-up of 13.2 months (range, 1.4-78.1 months), median progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly different according to HER2 status: 3.1 months in patients with HER2 amplification compared with 5.6 months in those with non-amplified HER2 (HR = 2.73; 95% CI = 1.18-6.31; P = 0.019). Overall survival (OS) was not significantly different between groups, although there was a tendency towards shorter OS in patients with HER2-amplified tumors (HR = 0.31; 95% CI = 0.61-2.82; 10.1 vs. 13.5 months; P = 0.488).
706	PTEN	LOSS	B	Trastuzumab	Resistance	In a retrospective study of 111 HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab-based therapy, PTEN loss (as measured by IHC) was associated with shorter survival as measured from initiation of trastuzumab (HR = 1.92, P = 0.017) and diagnosis of first metastasis (HR = 1.69, P = 0.047).
707	PIK3CA	WILDTYPE	B	Aspirin	Sensitivity/Response	This was a retrospective study of 964 colorectal cancer patients who participated in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Of 964 patients, 803 patients had wildtype PIK3CA (aspirin use: 337/803, no aspirin use: 466/803) and 161 had mutated PIK3CA (aspirin use: 66/161, no aspirin use: 95/161). Among patients with wild-type PIK3CA, regular use of aspirin after diagnosis was not significantly associated with increased survival. The 5-year cumulative colorectal cancer specific mortality was the same (15%) for users and nonusers of aspirin after diagnosis (P = 0.92).
708	PTEN	LOSS	B	Trastuzumab	Resistance	In a retrospective study of 182 metastatic breast cancer patients of mixed HER2 status treated with trastuzumab-based therapy, PTEN loss (as measured by IHC) was associated with a higher risk of death measured from initiation of trastuzumab (HR = 1.64, P = 0.029) and diagnosis of first metastasis (HR = 1.85, P = 0.003).
642	CD274	EXPRESSION	B	Pembrolizumab	Sensitivity/Response	This open-label, randomized, phase-3 clinical trial compared pembrolizumab to chemotherapy in treating NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells and no sensitizing mutation of EGFR or translocation of ALK. Patients in the pembrolizumab group exhibited significantly better progression-free survival and overall survival compared to patients in the chemotherapy group.
717	KIT	EXPRESSION	B	Imatinib	Sensitivity/Response	In a prospective phase III study (SWOG S0033/CALGB 150105) of 407 patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), 397 patients were observed to be CD117-positive (i.e. KIT-positive) and 10 patients were CD117-negative. Patients were treated with either 400mg or 800mg of imatinib per day. When compared to CD117-positive, GISTs, CD117-negative GISTs did not show significant difference in median time to progression (18.3 months vs. 20.5 months; P = 0.46), however, CD-117-negative GISTs showed reduced overall survival relative to CD-117-positive GISTs (25.8 months vs. 57.1 months; P= 0.01).
718	EGFR	WILDTYPE	B	Gefitinib	Resistance	In a phase 3 clinical trial of East Asian pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients, a subset of patients with EGFR mutations (n=261) treated with gefitinib were associated with improved response compared to carboplatin plus paclitaxel treatment, but in patients shown to be negative for EGFR mutation (n=176), patients given gefitinib fared worse than those given carboplatin and paclitaxel: Hazard ratio 2.85 (85% CI 2.05-3.98) p<0.001
639	SGK1	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Alpelisib	Resistance	A group of 18 breast cancer patients were treated with PI3Kalpha inhibitor alpelisib (NVP-BYL719) plus an aromatase inhbitor (NCT01870505). 3 out of 3 patients expressing high tumor SGK1 mRNA had disease progression as best response with median progression free survival (PFS) of 56 days, while 15 patients classified with low to medium SGK1 mRNA had median PFS 111 days with 4/15 having disease progression as best response.
633	EGFR	EXPRESSION	B	Cetuximab	Sensitivity/Response	57 patients with chemorefractory colorectal cancer expressing EGFR (IHC staining) were treated with single-agent cetuximab in this phase 2 study. Five patients (9%; 95% CI, 3% to 19%) achieved a partial response. Twenty-one additional patients had stable disease or minor responses. The median survival in these previously treated patients with chemotherapy-refractory colorectal cancer was 6.4 months.
632	EGFR	EXPRESSION	B	Panitumumab	Sensitivity/Response	463 patients with 1% or more EGFR tumor cell membrane staining, with metastatic CRC progressive after standard chemotherapy were randomized to panitumumab plus best supportive care (BSC, n = 231) or BSC alone (n = 232). Panitumumab significantly prolonged PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.66, [P < .0001]). Objective response rates favored panitumumab over BSC; after a 12-month minimum follow-up, response rates were 10% for panitumumab and 0% for BSC (P < .0001). No difference was observed in OS (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.22), but 76% of BSC patients entered the cross-over study.
624	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Lapatinib	Sensitivity/Response	Phase 2 study in 27 patients with HER2 positive (IHC, FISH), KRAS wt metastatic colorectal cancer refractory to standard of care received trastuzumab and lapatinib. After a median follow-up of 94 weeks, eight (30%, 95% CI 14-50) of 27 patients had achieved an objective response, with one patient (4%, 95% CI -3 to 11) achieving a complete response, and seven (26%, 95% CI 9-43) achieving partial responses; 12 (44%, 95% CI 25-63) patients had stable disease. A total of 914 patients with KRAS wt were screened for this study, 48 patients (5%) were identified to have HER2-positive tumors.

After a median follow-up of 94 weeks, eight (30%, 95% CI 14-50) of 27 patients had achieved an objective response, with one patient (4%, 95% CI -3 to 11) achieving a complete response, and seven (26%, 95% CI 9-43) achieving partial responses; 12 (44%, 95% CI 25-63) patients had stable disease. A total of 914 patients with KRAS wt were screened for this study, 48 patients (5%) were identified to have HER2-positive tumors.
622	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Cetuximab	Resistance	HER2 amplification (FISH) was assessed in 170 KRAS wt mCRC patients treated with cetuximab or panitumumab. HER2 copy number status was significantly correlated with response rate, PFS and OS. Patients with amplification in all neoplastic cells (4%) had worse outcome compared to patients without amplification (35%, intermediate outcome) or amplification in minor clones (61%, highest survival probability).
621	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Panitumumab	Resistance	HER2 amplification (FISH) was assessed in 170 KRAS wt mCRC patients treated with cetuximab or panitumumab. HER2 copy number status was significantly correlated with response rate, PFS and OS. Patients with amplification in all neoplastic cells (4%) had worse outcome compared to patients without amplification (35%, intermediate outcome) or amplification in minor clones (61%, highest survival probability).
620	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Cetuximab	Resistance	A cohort of patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from 85 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer was created. PDX were treated with cetuximab and mechanisms of resistance investigated. None of the xenografts harboring KRAS (N=18), NRAS (N=7) or BRAF (N=3) mutations showed resistance whereas 1 out of 4 xenografts with a PIK3CA mutation responded to cetuximab. Among 11 quadruple-negative samples with resistance to cetuximab, HER2 overexpression and amplification (N=3) and amplification (N=1) were identified. In an independent second retrospective cohort, 3 out of 17 patients with KRAS wt, cetuximab resitant CRC were found to harbor HER2 overexpression and amplification. In this cohort no HER2 overexpression or amplification was identified in 14 KRAS wt patients with response to cetuximab.
619	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Cetuximab	Resistance	A cohort of patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from 85 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer was created. PDX were treated with cetuximab and mechanisms of resistance investigated. None of the xenografts harboring KRAS (N=18), NRAS (N=7) or BRAF (N=3) mutations showed a response to cetuximab whereas 1 out of 4 xenografts with a PIK3CA mutation responded to cetuximab. Among 11 quadruple-negative samples with resistance to cetuximab, HER2 overexpression and amplification (N=3) and amplification (N=1) were identified. In an independent second retrospective patient cohort, 3 out of 17 patients with KRAS wt, cetuximab resitant CRC were found to harbor HER2 overexpression and amplification. In this cohort no HER2 overexpression or amplification was identified in 14 KRAS wt patients with response to cetuximab.
618	HIF1A	EXPRESSION	B	Pazopanib	Sensitivity/Response	Immunohistochemical staining for HIF1A was performed on tumor samples from 65 patients that received pazopanib as part of VEG102616, of which 17 were classified as low expression and 48 were classified as high expression. The response rates of patients with low and high HIF1a expression to pazopanib were 52.9% and 29.1% (p=0.13), and there was no significant difference in PFS between the two groups (p=0.25). The authors concluded that HIF1a expression levels are not associated with clinical response to pazopanib.
617	EPAS1	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Pazopanib	Sensitivity/Response	HIF2A (EPAS1) staining was conducted on tumors from 66 patients, of which 27 were classified as low expression and 39 were classified as high expression. The response rates of patients with low and high HIF2A expression to pazopanib were 44% and 33% (p=0.36) respectively and no significant difference in PFS between the two groups (p=0.76) was observed. The authors concluded that HIF2A expression levels are not associated with clinical response to pazopanib.
613	AURKA	EXPRESSION	B	Cisplatin	Sensitivity/Response	A retrospective study examining the expression of AURKA in tumor samples of 78 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients found that positive expression of AURKA (>10% of cells by IHC) was correlated with increased clinical response to chemoradiation therapy consisting of cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and 40 gy radiation (P = 0.0003).
612	AURKA	EXPRESSION	B	Radiation Therapy	Sensitivity/Response	A retrospective study examining the expression of AURKA in tumor samples of 78 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients found that positive expression of AURKA (>10% of cells by IHC) was correlated with increased clinical response to chemoradiation therapy consisting of cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and 40 gy radiation (P = 0.0003).
611	AURKA	EXPRESSION	B	Fluorouracil	Sensitivity/Response	A retrospective study examining the expression of AURKA in tumor samples of 78 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients found that positive expression of AURKA (>10% of cells by IHC) was correlated with increased clinical response to chemoradiation therapy consisting of cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and 40 gy radiation (P = 0.0003).
610	AURKA	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Platinum Compound	Resistance	A study of 41 patients with high-grade ovarian serous carcinoma found that high expression levels of AURKA correlated with poorer overall survival (P = 0.001; HR 0.14) and platinum therapy resistance (P < 0.001). Expression of AURKA was measured using immunohistochemical techniques on tumor samples.
816	ALK	FUSION	B	Entrectinib	Sensitivity/Response	Two phase I studies in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including patients with active central nervous system (CNS) disease. Here, we summarize the overall safety and report the antitumor activity of entrectinib in a cohort of patients with tumors harboring NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, or ALK gene fusions Responses were observed in non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, mammary analogue secretory carcinoma, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma, as early as 4 weeks after starting treatment and lasting as long as >2 years. Notably, a complete CNS response was achieved in a patient with SQSTM1-NTRK1-rearranged lung cancer.
966	BRCA2	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	B	Talazoparib	Sensitivity/Response	In part 2 of a two-part dose-escalation phase I trial (NCT01286987), 71 patients with Ewings sarcoma, breast, ovarian, small cell lung, or pancreatic cancers received 1.0 mg/day talazoparib treatment. Of patients with BRCA mutation-associated breast and ovarian cancers, confirmed responses were observed in 7 of 14 (50%) and 5 of 12 (42%) patients, respectively.
819	NTRK1	AMPLIFICATION	B	Entrectinib	Sensitivity/Response	Entrectinib, a potent oral inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases TRKA/B/C, ROS1, and ALK, was evaluated in two phase I studies in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including CNS disease. Responses were observed in non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, mammary analogue secretory carcinoma, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma, as early as 4 weeks after starting treatment and lasting as long as >2 years. No objective responses (per RECIST v1.1) were observed in patients whose tumors did not harbor gene fusions involving NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, or ALK, with the exception of 1 patient with an ALKF1245V mutant neuroblastoma.
564	ESR1	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Palbociclib	Sensitivity/Response	A phase 2 clinical trial evaluated 165 patients with oestrogen receptor positive and HER2-negative breast cancer such that 84 patients received combination therapy of palbociclib plus letrozole and 81 patients received letrozole alone. The combination therapy arm had higher median duration of progression-free survival when compared to the letrozole only group (20.2 months vs. 10.2 months; p<0.0004). A subcategory of patients taking combination therapy, who lacked mutations in p16 or CCND1 (n=34), had an even higher median free survival of 26.1 months. Noticeable side effects in the combination therapy group included neutropenia (54%) leucopenia (19%), fatigue (4%) back pain (2%), diarrhea (2%) and pulmonary embolism (4%).
514	ALK	FUSION	B	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	In a retrospective study comparing survival outcomes in a subgroup of 82 ALK-positive crizotinib-treated patients enrolled in a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT00585195), crizotinib therapy was associated with improved survival. For the crizotinib-treated, ALK-positive patient group, 1 year survival was 74% and 2 year overall survival was 54%, compared with 72% and 36% for the control group (ALK-positive crizotinib naive patients).
871	ABL1	BCR::ABL Y253H	B	Dasatinib	Resistance	This is a retrospective study of imatinib-resistant (n = 805) or -intolerant (n = 238), chronic myeloid leukemia (chronic-phase), patients with mutations in the BCR-ABL gene fusion kinase domain from the START-C, START-R, and CA180-034 trials. With dasatinib monotherapy, patients with and without ABL1 mutation  had comparable complete hematologic response (CHR), major cytogenetic response (MCyR), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), and major molecular response (MMR). Out of 23 patients with the Y253H mutation, 14, 15, and 20 achieved CCyR, MCyR, and CHR with dasatinib monotherapy, respectively. Analyses by variant included patients with multiple kinase domain mutations.
508	ABL1	BCR::ABL T315I	B	Ponatinib	Sensitivity/Response	Study describes a phase 1 clinical trial of ponatinib in treatment of 81 refractory Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias. 43 of these patients were considered to have chronic-phase CML. All 12 chronic-phase CML patients with a T315I mutation showed a complete hematologic response. Furthermore, 91% of these patients were estimated to  remain in response at 1 year (95% CI, Kaplan-Meier analysis).
507	PTEN	LOSS	B	Trastuzumab	Resistance	While some reports indicate PTEN loss is associated with resistance to trastuzumab, in a subgroup of HER2 breast cancer FFPE samples from patients receiving trastuzumab as later line therapy (second or greater line therapy), with 25 PTEN loss and and 25 normal samples, no association was seen between trastuzumab response and PTEN status (p=1.000) or overall survival and PTEN status (p=0.863).
506	PTEN	LOSS	B	Trastuzumab	Resistance	A subgroup of HER2-positive breast cancer patients that received first-line trastuzumab treatment were assessed for PTEN loss via IHC of FFPE samples. 46 samples showed PTEN loss while 41 did not, and PTEN loss alone was found to be significantly associated with resistance to trastuzumab (p=0.028) and shorter overall survival (p=0.008).
877	ABL1	BCR::ABL E255K	B	Dasatinib	Resistance	This is a retrospective study of imatinib-resistant (n = 805) or -intolerant (n = 238), chronic myeloid leukemia (chronic-phase), patients with mutations in the BCR-ABL gene fusion kinase domain from the START-C, START-R, and CA180-034 trials. With dasatinib monotherapy, patients with and without ABL1 mutation  had comparable complete hematologic response (CHR), major cytogenetic response (MCyR), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), and major molecular response (MMR). Out of 16 patients with E255K mutations, 6, 9, and 14 achieved CCyR, MCyR, and CHR with dasatinib monotherapy, respectively. Analyses by variant included patients with multiple kinase domain mutations.
886	ABL1	BCR::ABL T315I	B	Dasatinib	Resistance	This is a retrospective study of imatinib-resistant (n = 805) or -intolerant (n = 238), chronic myeloid leukemia (chronic-phase), patients with mutations in the BCR-ABL gene fusion kinase domain from the START-C, START-R, and CA180-034 trials. With dasatinib monotherapy, patients with and without ABL1 mutation had comparable complete hematologic response (CHR), major cytogenetic response (MCyR), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), and major molecular response (MMR). Out of 21 patients with T315I mutations, 0, 2, and 6 achieved CCyR, MCyR, and CHR to dasatinib monotherapy, respectively. Analyses by variant included patients with multiple kinase domain mutations. Of the 63 variants considered, the authors associate T315I, F317L, and V299L with resistance to dasatinib or lower levels of response due to clinical resistance and low in vitro sensitivity. They suggest considering alternative treatment options for patients with these variants.
494	CDK4	AMPLIFICATION	B	Palbociclib	Sensitivity/Response	In a phase 2 clinical trial, NCT01209598, 30 patients with CDK4-amplified and RB-expressing well differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas (WDLS/DDLS) were treated with a selective CDK 4/6 inhibitor, PD0332991. Treatment with PD0332991 was associated with favorable progression free survival rates (66% PFS rate, primary end point being greater than 40%) suggesting that CDK4 amplification is predictive of sensitivity to CDK4 inhibitor therapy.

466	MLH1	METHYLATION	B	Oxaliplatin	Resistance	The methylation status of MLH1 was analyzed in a study of 53 paraffin-embedded gastric cancer samples. No association was found between methylation status and clinical factors. The study showed that MLH1 methylation was associated with resistance to treatment with oxaliplatin.
515	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Trastuzumab Emtansine	Sensitivity/Response	In a randomized phase II study, first line treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) resulted in improved progression free survival and fewer serious adverse effects when compared to treatment with combination trastuzumab plus docetaxel (HT) (median follow up 14 months, median PFS with T-DM1 14.2 vs 9.2 with HT).
927	ABL1	BCR::ABL F359I	B	Dasatinib	Resistance	This is a retrospective study of imatinib-resistant (n = 805) or -intolerant (n = 238), chronic myeloid leukemia (chronic-phase), patients with mutations in the BCR-ABL gene fusion kinase domain from the START-C, START-R, and CA180-034 trials. With dasatinib monotherapy, patients with and without ABL1 mutation had comparable complete hematologic response (CHR), major cytogenetic response (MCyR), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), and major molecular response (MMR). Out of 12 patients with F359I mutations, 7, 10, and 12 achieved CCyR, MCyR, and CHR with dasatinib monotherapy, respectively. Analyses by variant included patients with multiple kinase domain mutations.
456	FLT3	TKD MUTATION	B	Midostaurin	Sensitivity/Response	In a phase 2 clinical study of 95 AML/high-risk MDS patients treated with either 50 or 100 mg midostaurin, 35 harbored FLT3 mutations (26 had FLT3 ITD, 9 had FLT3 D835Y mutations). A higher percentage of patients saw blast reductions in the FLT3 mutant group than in the FLT3 wild type group (71 vs 42%). Only one permanent response occurred in a FLT3 mutant patient receiving the 100 mg dose. No differences were observed in toxicity or response rate between the two doses of midostaurin.
444	BCL2L11	DELETION POLYMORPHISM	B	Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor	Resistance	The BIM (BCL2L11) deletion polymorphism was identified in an EGFR Mutant NSCLC cell line with resistance to EGFR-TKI (HCC2779). Introduction of this polymorphism in a previously EGFR-inhibitor sensitive cell line led to TKI-resistance. In 141 NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations, the presence of the polymorphism (N=26) was predictive of a significantly shorter PFS under treatment with EGFR-TKI (6.6 months vs. 11.9 months, p = 0.0027). Patients received either gefitinib only (N=136) or erlotinib only (N=5).
443	BCL2L11	DELETION POLYMORPHISM	B	Imatinib	Resistance	DNA sequencing was performed in five Ph+ CML samples with sensitivity or resistance to imatinib. A structural variation in BIM2 (BCL2L11) with an identical 2,903-bp genomic deletion was identified in all three resistant samples. 2,597 healthy individuals were screened and the deletion polymorphism was identified in 12.3% of East Asian Population but 0% in African or European Population. In-vitro, imatinib-induced apoptosis was reduced in cells harboring the BIM deletion polymorphism. Two East Asian CML cohorts (n=203) treated with imatinib were analzed for the polymorphism. Overall odds ratio for resistant disease among subjects with the deletion polymorphism compared to those without it was 2.94 (P = 0.02, 95% CI 1.17–7.43). Patients with the polymorphism, compared to those without, were more likely to be resistant without BCR-ABL mutations than resistant with BCR-ABL mutation or sensitive (odds ratio = 1.90, 95% CI 1.08–4.35).
442	ALK	FUSION	B	Alectinib	Sensitivity/Response	In this Phase I trial (NCT01588028) in 47 patients, alectinib was assessed for its effectiveness in treating locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC that had progressed or been resistant to crizotinib treatment. ALK rearrangement was assessed via approved break apart FISH kit, and patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were also included. Patients were divided into different cohorts receiving different doses of alectinib. In the 600 mg cohort (N=13), there were 4 confirmed partial responses, 3 unconfirmed partial responses and 3 instances of stable disease. Also, five of nine patients throughout the cohorts with measurable baseline CNS lesions showed partial response to alectinib. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of alectinib increased linearly with blood alectinib levels, indicating it effectively crossed the blood-brain barrier.
440	ALK	FUSION	B	Alectinib	Sensitivity/Response	In this initial report of a single-arm Phase I and II study (JapicCTI-101264) of alectinib (CH5424802), 46 patients with advanced or metastatic ALK-rearranged non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were assessed for objective response during phase II. ALK positivity was assessed via IHC and verified with FISH or RT-PCR. Patients had received one or more rounds of previous chemotherapy, but no prior targeted therapy towards ALK. From the 46 patients, 41 showed partial response, and 2 showed complete response. CNS metastases in three patients which had not received prior brain irradiation showed response to alectinib. Alectinib was generally well tolerated, and the authors conclude that alectinib compared favorably to crizotinib and could be an effective and safe option in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.
282	PTEN	EXPRESSION	B	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	Trastuzumab was more effective in cell lines (SKBR3 vs. drug-resistant SKBR3/R) and 17 patient samples that exhibit elevated PTEN expression (by IHC).
957	EGFR	RARE EXON 18-21 MUTATION	B	Erlotinib	Sensitivity/Response	In a cohort of NSCLC patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib or gefitinib, 61 patients with uncommon mutations of unknown clinical significance (UMUCS) in EGFR exons 18-21 responded at a rate of 47.5% (primarily G719 and L861, N=30/61). This was significantly greater (p<0.001) than a response rate of 16.5% in EGFR wild type patients but significantly smaller (p<0.001) than a 74.1% response in EGFR mutant patients with canonical exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation. Uncommon mutations also had greater median PFS (5.0 vs. 2.0 months, P < 0.001) and median overall survival (15.0 vs. 10.4 months, P = 0.030) than in patients with the wild-type EGFR.

This was significantly greater (p<0.001) than a response rate of 16.5% in EGFR wild type patients but significantly smaller (p<0.001) than a 74.1% response in EGFR mutant patients with canonical exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation. Uncommon mutations also had greater median PFS (5.0 vs. 2.0 months, P < 0.001) and median overall survival (15.0 vs. 10.4 months, P = 0.030) than in patients with the wild-type EGFR.
959	EGFR	EX19 DEL L858R	B	Gefitinib	Sensitivity/Response	In a study of 1261 non-small cell lung cancer patients, 49.8% of the analyzed tumors had EGFR mutations including deletions in exon 19 (n=258), L858R (n=260), T790M (n=6) and insertions or duplications in exon 20 (n=25). Patients with EGFR deletions in exon 19 or L858R mutations were associated with an improved response to erlotinib or gefitinib with partial or complete response (74.1% vs. 16.5%, P<0.001) when compared to wildtype EGFR patients. Additionally, tumors with EGFR mutations in L858R or deletions in exon 19 were associated with increased overall survival (19.6mo vs. 10.4mo) compared to wildtype (all patients were treated with either erlotinib or gefitinib). From 61 patients with uncommon EGFR mutations of unknown clinical significance, 47.5% were responders in contrast to the 74.1% responders in the exon 19 deletion/L858R group.
960	EGFR	EX19 DEL L858R	B	Erlotinib	Sensitivity/Response	In a study of 1261 non-small cell lung cancer patients, 49.8% of the analyzed tumors had EGFR mutations including deletions in exon 19 (n=258), L858R (n=260), T790M (n=6) and insertions or duplications in exon 20 (n=25). Patients with EGFR deletions in exon 19 or L858R mutations were associated with an improved response to erlotinib or gefitinib with partial or complete response (74.1% vs. 16.5%, P<0.001) when compared to wildtype EGFR patients. Additionally, tumors with EGFR mutations in L858R or deletions in exon 19 were associated with increased overall survival (19.6mo vs. 10.4mo) compared to wildtype (all patients were treated with either erlotinib or gefitinib). From 61 patients with uncommon EGFR mutations of unknown clinical significance, 47.5% were responders in contrast to the 74.1% responders in the exon 19 deletion/L858R group.
961	EGFR	RARE EXON 18-21 MUTATION	B	Erlotinib	Sensitivity/Response	In a cohort of NSCLC patients tested for mutation in EGFR exons 18-21 a subset had uncommon mutations of unknown clinical significance (UMUCS). The most commonly occurring UMUCS were G719 and L861 mutations. Among patients that had UMUCS but not G719 or L861, the response rate to tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib or gefitinib, progression free survival, and overall survival were 20%, 1.6 month and 11.1 months, which was similar for wild type EGFR (16.5%, 2.0 months and 10.4 months), which contrasted to higher response for more commonly occurring G719 and L861 mutations (53.3% and 60.0%, respectively).
962	EGFR	RARE EXON 18-21 MUTATION	B	Gefitinib	Sensitivity/Response	In a cohort of NSCLC patients tested for mutation in EGFR exons 18-21 a subset had uncommon mutations of unknown clinical significance (UMUCS). The most commonly occurring UMUCS were G719 and L861 mutations. Among patients that had UMUCS but not G719 or L861, the response rate to tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib or gefitinib, progression free survival, and overall survival were 20%, 1.6 month and 11.1 months, which was similar for wild type EGFR (16.5%, 2.0 months and 10.4 months), which contrasted to higher response for more commonly occurring G719 and L861 mutations (53.3% and 60.0%, respectively).
964	ALK	FUSION	B	Brigatinib	Sensitivity/Response	In a phase II randomized trial we evaluated two regimens of Brigatinib in Crizotinib-refractory ALK-pos. NSCLC. They were randomly assigned (1:1) to oral Brigatinib 90 mg once daily (arm A) or 180 mg once daily with a 7-day lead-in at 90 mg. Of 222 patients enrolled (arm A: n = 112, arm B: n = 110), 154 (69%) had baseline brain metastases and 164 of 222 (74%) had received prior chemotherapy. ORR was 45 (arm A) and 54% (B). Investigator-assessed median PFS was 9.2 months (A) and 12.9 months (B). Independent review committee-assessed intracranial ORR in patients with measurable brain metastases at baseline was 42% (11/26, A) and 67% (12/18, B). Brigatinib yielded substantial whole-body and intracranial responses as well as robust PFS; 180 mg (with lead-in) showed consistently better efficacy than 90 mg, with acceptable safety.
457	PTEN	LOSS	B	Everolimus	Sensitivity/Response	Archival tumor samples from 549 patients from the BOLERO-1 and -3 trials were analyzed for alterations in the PI3K pathway using next-generation sequencing, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Sanger sequencing. In the BOLERO trials, patients with HER2-overexpressing advanced breast cancer were treated with trastuzumab, chemotherapy and randomized to receive either everolimus or placebo. In the pooled analysis of both trials, patients with PTEN loss (as defined by IHC staining intensity and proportion of positive tumor cells) had a longer progression-free survival with everolimus compared to placebo (HR 0.54 (95%CI 0.31 to 0.96, P=0.04) whereas patients with PTEN normal status had a hazard ration of 1.00 (95%CI 0.8 to 1.26, P=0.97). The same was found when PI3K mutations, PTEN loss and AKT E17K mutations were combined and analyzed as hyperactive PI3K pathway. Patients with PI3K hyperactive pathway had a hazard ratio of 0.67 (95%CI 0.48 to 0.93, P=0.02) compared to HR 1.19 (95%CI 0.87 to 1.62, P=0.28) in patients with PI3K normal pathway. These trends were independently confirmed in both trials but only pooled results showed consistent statistical significance.
516	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Docetaxel	Sensitivity/Response	In a randomized phase 3 trial, HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer patients given first-line treatment of pertuzumab plus trastuzumb plus docetaxel experienced improved progression free survival (18.5 vs 12.4 months,  P<0.001) and increased objective response rate (80.2% vs 69.3%, P=0.001) than the control group given placebo plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel.
517	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Pertuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	In a randomized phase 3 trial, HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer patients given first-line treatment of pertuzumab plus trastuzumb plus docetaxel experienced improved progression free survival (18.5 vs 12.4 months,  P<0.001) and increased objective response rate (80.2% vs 69.3%, P=0.001) than the control group given placebo plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel.

563	ESR1	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Letrozole	Sensitivity/Response	A phase 2 clinical trial evaluated 165 patients with oestrogen receptor positive and HER2-negative breast cancer such that 84 patients received combination therapy of palbociclib plus letrozole and 81 patients received letrozole alone. The combination therapy arm had higher median duration of progression-free survival when compared to the letrozole only group (20.2 months vs. 10.2 months; p<0.0004). A subcategory of patients taking combination therapy, who lacked mutations in p16 or CCND1 (n=34), had an even higher median free survival of 26.1 months. Noticeable side effects in the combination therapy group included neutropenia (54%) leucopenia (19%), fatigue (4%) back pain (2%), diarrhea (2%) and pulmonary embolism (4%).
562	CCND1	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Palbociclib	Sensitivity/Response	A pharmacodynamic study (NCT00420056) of 17 mantle cell lymphoma MCL patients was performed using the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib (PD0332991). Patients were verified by IHC, FISH or molecular testing for the t(11:14) rearrangement causing Cyclin D overexpression in MCL. 1 patient demonstrated complete response, and 2 showed partial response for an 18% overall response rate. 7 patients showed stable disease. Patient population was heavily pretreated.
825	TP53	WILDTYPE	B	RG7112	Sensitivity/Response	Phase I Trial of RG7112 in 116 heavily pretreated patients with AML, ALL, CML, CLL, sCLL demonstrated sustained clinical improvement and induction of TP53 target genes in subset of patients with wild type TP53. 96 patients were tested for TP53 mutation and 19 cases of mutation were detected. No sustained clinical improvement or induction of TP53 target genes was observed in patients with mutant TP53.
826	TP53	DELETERIOUS MUTATION	B	RG7112	Resistance	Phase I Trial of MDM2 inhibitor RG7112 in 116 patients with AML, ALL, CML, CLL, sCLL demonstrated sustained clinical improvement and induction of TP53 target genes in subset of patients with wild type TP53. No sustained clinical improvement or induction of TP53 target genes was observed in patients with mutant TP53.
834	CD274	EXPRESSION	B	Radiation Therapy	Resistance	Radiation-resistant cell lines exhibited upregulation and increased activation of Axl, PI3 kinase signalling as well as increased expression of PD-L1. In 3 cohorts of HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patient samples evaluated with different methods [reverse phase protein array (N=68), mRNA expression array (N=97) or immunohistochemistry (N=114), respectively], increased expression of PD-L1 was also correlated with local failure following radiotherapy as compared to the PD-L1–low expression group (P = 0.01, 1.9 × 10−3, and 9 × 10−4, respectively).
838	TP53	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Cisplatin	Resistance	In a study involving patients with invasive ovarian carcinoma who had undergone surgery, a subset of 73 patients were classified via response to platinum-based chemotherapy as sensitive or resistant/refractory and tested for p53 overexpression (>10% postive stained nuclei). 78% of p53 negative patients were classified as sensitive, in compariston to 39% of p53 positive patients (p=0.001).
557	CDK6	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Fulvestrant	Resistance	In two cohorts (n=45 and n=46) of ER+ breast cancer patients who had received fulvestrant, CDK6 overexpression correlated with shorter median time to progression in both cohorts (2.5 vs. 8.2 months and 3.4 vs. 8.9 months for CDK6 overexpression vs. normal expression). CDK6 expression did not correlate with other lines of treatment (N=68, tamoxifen or endocrine therapy). Four fulvestrant-resistant cell lines were derived from estrogen responsive and fulvestrant sensitive parental breast cancer cell line MCF-7/SO.5. Gene expression profiling showed upregulation of CDK6 in the fulvestrant resistant derivatives. Knockdown of CDK6 in these derivative cells resulted in fulvestrant sensitivity.
839	TP53	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Carboplatin	Resistance	In a study involving patients with invasive ovarian carcinoma who had undergone surgery, a subset of 73 patients were classified via response to platinum-based chemotherapy as sensitive or resistant/refractory and tested for p53 overexpression (>10% postive stained nuclei). 78% of p53 negative patients were classified as sensitive, in compariston to 39% of p53 positive patients (p=0.001).
842	FGFR1	AMPLIFICATION	B	Dovitinib	Sensitivity/Response	Clinical trial studied the efficacy of Dovitinib on 26 patients with FGFR1 amplifications. Objective response for the cohort was 11.5%, disease control rate was 50%. 11.5% of patients exhibited partial response, 38.5% exhibited stable disease. Median PFS was 2.9 months, median OS was 5 months, this trend was worse with increases in FGFR1 amplification above average.

539	PTEN	LOSS	B	Chemotherapy	Resistance	Cancer and normal tissue samples were taken from 68 gastric cancer patients undergoing surgery without prior chemotherapy. Tissue samples were divided into high grade and low grade for phospho Akt (p-Akt) expression, and tested for PTEN LOH by sequencing. Patients with PTEN LOH were significantly more likely to have elevated p-Akt (p=0.0081), and high p-Akt samples were significantly less sensitive to chemotherapy agents 5-flourouracil, adriamycin, mitomycin and cis-platinum in MTT assay.
849	ABL1	BCR::ABL F359V	B	Dasatinib	Resistance	This is a retrospective study of imatinib-resistant (n = 805) or -intolerant (n = 238), chronic myeloid leukemia (chronic-phase) patients with mutations in the BCR-ABL gene fusion kinase domain from the START-C, START-R, and CA180-034 trials. With dasatinib monotherapy, patients with and without ABL1 mutation had comparable complete hematologic response (CHR), major cytogenetic response (MCyR), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), and major molecular response (MMR). Of the 27 with F359V mutations, 14, 17, and 25 achieved CCyR, MCyR, and CHR with dasatinib monotherapy, respectively. Analyses by variant included patients with multiple kinase domain mutations.
852	KIT	WILDTYPE	B	Regorafenib	Sensitivity/Response	This phase II clinical trial of regorafenib (NCT01068769) examined the long term safety and efficacy of regorafenib in patients with metastatic and/or unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) who failed previous treatments with imatinib. Patients whose GISTs were wildtype for KIT and PDGFR and who were succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) deficient (n=6) experienced higher rates of clinical benefit (defined as complete response, partial response, or stable disease lasting >16 weeks) than patients whose GISTs were wildtype for KIT and PDGFR but were not SDH deficient (n=2). 6/6 patients with SDH deficient GISTs had clinical benefit (including 2 PRs), and their median PFS was 10 months vs 1.6 months for patients with non-SDH deficient GISTs.

Analyses by variant included patients with multiple kinase domain mutations.
533	KIT	AMPLIFICATION	B	Imatinib	Resistance	Phase 2 trial in metastatic mucosal, acral or chronically sun-damaged melanoma. Twenty-five patients were enrolled (24 evaluable). Eight patients (33%) had tumors with KIT mutations, 11 (46%) with KIT amplifications, and five (21%) with both. Median follow-up was 10.6 months. Best overall response rate was statistically significantly different by mutation status: 7 of 13 or 54% KIT mutated v 0% KIT amplified only.
529	BIRC5	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Trastuzumab	Resistance	13 HER2 breast cancer patients were treated with trastuzumab and then trastuzumab + docetaxel prior to surgery. Pretreatment biopsies and post-treatment surgical samples were obtained, and microarray performed. 5 of 13 patients responded to treatment, and pretreatment biopsies from non-responders showed significantly higher survivin (BIRC5) mRNA (p=0.026) levels than responders. In HER2 positive, trastuzumab-sensitive BT474 cells, overexpression of survivin blunted sensitivity to trastuzumab. In HER2 positive trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cell lines, knockdown of survivin with RNAi or with YM155 induced growth inhibition and apoptosis.
862	ABL1	BCR::ABL G250E	B	Dasatinib	Resistance	This is a retrospective study of imatinib-resistant (n = 805) or -intolerant (n = 238), chronic myeloid leukemia (chronic-phase), patients with mutations in the BCR-ABL gene fusion kinase domain from the START-C, START-R, and CA180-034 trials. With dasatinib monotherapy, patients with and without ABL1 mutation  had comparable complete hematologic response (CHR), major cytogenetic response (MCyR), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), and major molecular response (MMR).

Analyses by variant included patients with multiple kinase domain mutations.
522	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	In a randomized open label phase 3 study (NCT00553358), women with HER2 positive primary breast cancer treated with lapatinib plus trasuzumab had higher rates of pathological complete responses than seen in control groups receiving either IV trastuzumab or oral lapatinib alone (combination treatment pCR rate of 51% vs 29.5% and 24.7% for trastuzumab and lapatinib alone, respectively).
521	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Lapatinib	Sensitivity/Response	In a randomized open label phase 3 study (NCT00553358), women with HER2 positive primary breast cancer treated with lapatinib plus trasuzumab had higher rates of pathological complete responses than seen in control groups receiving either IV trastuzumab or oral lapatinib alone (combination treatment pCR rate of 51% vs 29.5% and 24.7% for trastuzumab and lapatinib alone, respectively).
820	NTRK3	AMPLIFICATION	B	Entrectinib	Sensitivity/Response	Entrectinib, a potent oral inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases TRKA/B/C, ROS1, and ALK, was evaluated in two phase I studies in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including CNS disease. Responses were observed in non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, mammary analogue secretory carcinoma, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma, as early as 4 weeks after starting treatment and lasting as long as >2 years. No objective responses (per RECIST v1.1) were observed in patients whose tumors did not harbor gene fusions involving NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, or ALK, with the exception of 1 patient with an ALKF1245V mutant neuroblastoma. Only 9 of 119 patients had NTRK Amplifications.
281	EGFR	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Gefitinib	Sensitivity/Response	82 patients treated with gefitinib were retrospectively analyzed for EGFR mRNA expression (rt-PCR in 64 patients). Patients with high EGFR mRNA expression (>5.01) had 43% response probability, whereas patients with low EGFR mRNA expression had 8% response probability (P = 0.006). PFS but not OS was also longer in patients with high EGFR mRNA expression.
337	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	This phase II single arm study assessed trastuzumab monotherapy in HER2 positive endometrial cancers with tumor response as primary endpoint.  Participants had stage III, IV or recurrent HER2 positive endometrial cancer.  During the trial's initial phase, 23 of 132 patients screened met the criteria of IHC2+ or 3+ or FISH positivity for HER2 status.  In the absence of results, the trial entered phase B, where only patients with HER2 amplification by FISH were admitted.  The trial ended early due to poor accrual with 11 of 154 screened meeting the phase B criteria. No major objective tumor responses were observed in the study.  28% of the cancers were of the serous type that had shown trastuzumab response in case studies.  The investigators note that in other HER2 cancers, such as breast and gastrointestinal, trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy has been found most effective, and could warrant more study.

1209	FGFR1	AMPLIFICATION	B	Lucitanib	Sensitivity/Response	In a phase 1 trial, patients with advanced solid tumors were treated with FGFR1/2, VEGFR1/2/3, and PDGFR inhibitor lucitanib. Among 12 patients with breast cancer harboring FGFR alterations (8 FGFR1 amplification, 4 11q amplification), 6 patients showed tumor response. The response rate was 50% and the duration of response was 48.7 weeks. Among the 8 patients with FGFR1 amplification, 4 showed a partial response and 4 achieved stable disease.
1200	FGFR2	FUSION	B	Derazantinib	Sensitivity/Response	Actionable fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusions have been identified in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (iCCA). Derazantinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor with potent pan-FGFR activity showed anti-tumour activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with advanced, unresectable iCCA with FGFR2 fusion who progressed after chemotherapy. In twenty-nine patients, overall response rate was 20.7%, disease control rate was 82.8%, and median PFS was 5.7 months (95% CI: 4.0–9.2). Similar to other pan-FGFR inhibitors, common AEs included asthenia/fatigue, hyperphosphatemia, eye toxicity and increase in ALT/AST.
105	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Neratinib	Sensitivity/Response	Oral neratinib showed objective response rates of 24 and 56% respectively in prior-trastuzumab (n=63) and trastuzumab-naive (n=64) cohorts in a Phase II trial. As for the primary endpoint, the 16-week progression free survival was 59% in the prior-trastuzumab + neratibin patients and 78% in the trastuzumab-naive + neratinib patients.

56	PTEN	LOSS	B	Trastuzumab	Resistance	PTEN loss is associated with loss of sensitivity to the HER2-antibody trastuzumab in breast cancer in smaller trials, a phase III trial (NCCTG N9831) did not show an effect of PTEN on disease-free survival.
57	BRCA2	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	B	Olaparib	Sensitivity/Response	In a phase 2 trial of patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer, treated with olaparib tablets at a dose of 400 mg twice a day, all 7 patients harbouring BRCA2 loss of function alleles (biallelic somatic loss or germline mutations in combination with somatic copy loss or copy neutral LOH) demonstrated a clinical response.
1273	BRAF	NON-V600	B	Trametinib	Sensitivity/Response	In a phase II basket trial (NCI-MATCH), patients with solid tumors or hematologic malignancies harboring BRAF non-V600 mutations were treated with trametinib. Among 50 patients assigned, 32 were eligible and received therapy with trametinib. Most common tumor histopathologic subtypes were GI cancers (n=8, of which 7 were colorectal adenocarcinoma), lung adenocarcinoma (n=9), prostate adenocarcinoma (n=4), gynecologic cancer (n=4),  BRAF alterations included BRAF fusion (n=1), G464 (n=2), G466 (n=4), G469 (n=7), N581 (n=3), D594 (n=11), L597 (n=2) and K601 (n=1). Of the 32 patients evaluable for efficacy endpoints, the response rate was 3% (3/32). The patient with a partial response had invasive breast cancer with a BRAF G469E mutation. The median PFS was 1.8 months and the median OS was 5.7 months.
1180	ABL1	BCR::ABL G250E	B	Imatinib Mesylate	Resistance	In a phase II study of 60 imatinib-resistant patients with BCR-ABL mutations, 9 had G250E mutations
62	TYMS	5' TANDEM REPEAT	B	Irinotecan	Resistance	The TYMS 5' 3TPR germline variant was significantly correlated with lower response to irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil treatment in colorectal cancer patients. 149 metastatic CRC patients treated with irinotecan/5FU as first-line chemotherapy were followed in this study.
63	TYMS	5' TANDEM REPEAT	B	Fluorouracil	Resistance	The TYMS 5' 3TPR germline variant was significantly correlated with lower response to irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil treatment in colorectal cancer patients. 149 metastatic CRC patients treated with irinotecan/5FU as first-line chemotherapy were followed in this study.
68	ROS1	REARRANGEMENT	B	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	An expansion cohort of a phase-1 Crizotinib study found a 72% objective response rate among 50 patients with ROS1 rearrangement. The study did not compare to patients without rearrangement that were treated with Crizotinib.  Several different ROS1 fusion partners were identified, but no clinical differences in outcome were associated with the identity of the 5' partner.
70	EGFR	AMPLIFICATION	B	Fluorouracil	Sensitivity/Response	EGFR amplification was not a predictor of response to cetuximab/5-FU/platinum in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSSC from the EXTREME study.
71	EGFR	AMPLIFICATION	B	Platinum Compound	Sensitivity/Response	EGFR amplification was not a predictor of response to cetuximab/5-FU/platinum in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSSC from the EXTREME study.
185	RSF1	AMPLIFICATION	B	Tamoxifen	Resistance	In retrospective study, 413 patients were assessed for RSF1 amplification. 28 patients with RSF1 amplification did not show a benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen compared to placebo (12 treated vs 16 placebo). 381 patients without amplification did show a benefit compared to placebo (187 treated vs 194 placebo).
72	EGFR	AMPLIFICATION	B	Cetuximab	Sensitivity/Response	EGFR amplification was not a predictor of response to cetuximab/5-FU/platinum in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSSC from the EXTREME study.
126	EREG	EXPRESSION	B	Cetuximab	Sensitivity/Response	226 cetuximab-treated patients with CRC were analyzed for mRNA expression of EGFR and its ligands. Favorable predictors in a multivariate analysis were high AREG mRNA in KRAS wild type tumours, high EREG mRNA and low Ephrin A2 receptor mRNA.
74	EGFR	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor	Sensitivity/Response	EGFR overexpression was correlated with longer overall survival in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with first line chemotherapy and cetuximab than those treated with first line chemotherapy alone.
75	CDKN2A	P16 EXPRESSION	B	Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor	Resistance	In this retrospective analysis of the SPECTRUM trial, p16 (CDKN2A) expression (and HPV-infection) was not predictive of response to EGFR-targeted therapy in combination with chemotherapy (n = 416 patient tumors).
76	CDKN2A	P16 EXPRESSION	B	Panitumumab	Resistance	In this retrospective analysis of p16 status as surrogate marker for HPV in the SPECTRUM trial, p16 (CDKN2A) expression was not associated with improved response to EGFR-directed therapy (Panitumumab) in combination with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone.
125	AREG	EXPRESSION	B	Cetuximab	Sensitivity/Response	226 cetuximab-treated patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) were analyzed for mRNA expression (by qPCR) of EGFR and its ligands (EGF, TGFA, AREG and EREG). High AREG mRNA expression in KRAS wild type tumours was a favorable predictor in a multivariate analysis (median survival 33 vs. 15 months, p=0.0005).   Cetuximab-treated patients with AREG-low KRAS wild type CRC had poor survival, similar to KRAS mutated CRC.
77	CDKN2A	P16 EXPRESSION	B	Cetuximab	Resistance	In this study response to EGFR-inhibition by cetuximab was independent of HPV-status, represented by expression of p16 (CDKN2A, an established biomarker of HPV infection). Expression of p16 was assayed in 69 HNSCC patients by IHC.
124	EGFR	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Nimotuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	55 tumor samples were analyzed for EGFR expression using IHC. The objective response rate to anti-EGFR antibody nimotuzumab did not differ significantly between EGFR high- (18 pts) and EGFR low to moderate groups (37 pts).
78	CD274	EXPRESSION	B	Nivolumab	Sensitivity/Response	Based on a meta-analysis of 20 trials (1475 patients), of which 7 studies (636 patients) included melanoma, PD-L1 expression was associated with a higher ORR rate in patients with melanoma. Active drugs were Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab, PD-1 receptor targeting antibodies.
79	CD274	EXPRESSION	B	Pembrolizumab	Sensitivity/Response	Based on a meta-analysis of 20 trials (1475 patients), of which 7 studies (636 patients) included melanoma, PD-L1 expression was associated with a higher ORR rate in patients with melanoma. Active drugs were Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab, PD-1 receptor targeting antibodies.
80	AKT2	EXPRESSION	B	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	In HER2+ metastatic breast cancer treated with trastuzumab (n = 74 patients), the expression of AKT2 and pAkt-Thr308 and/or pAkt-Ser473 localized in nucleus+cytoplasm was associated with an improved time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) compared to AKT2 negative tumors as measured by immunohistochemistry.
73	EGFR	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Cetuximab	Sensitivity/Response	EGFR expression level was not predicitive of response to cetuximab-containing first line regimens in recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and KRAS-wild type colorectal carcinoma.
186	CCND1	AMPLIFICATION	B	Tamoxifen	Resistance	In this retrospective analysis, CCND1 amplification was analyzed in 442 patients. No interaction with treatment was observed.
159	HMOX1	EXPRESSION	B	Sunitinib	Resistance	In 66 patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, high expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was associated with poor overall response rate (2.6% versus 53.6%, P<0.01), clinical benefit rate (47.4% versus 92.9%, P<0.01), shorter progression-free survival (4.4 versus 42 months, P=0.022) and poor overall survival (χ (2)=4.775, P=0.029) in patients receiving sorafenib or sunitinib.
233	TYMS	AMPLIFICATION	B	Pemetrexed	Resistance	TYMS copy number was lower in clinical samples responding to pemetrexed in combination with platinum (n=25). The same was found in 17 cell lines.
251	EGFR	Y1092 PHOSPHORYLATION	B	Erlotinib	Sensitivity/Response	While EGFR mutation is a strong predictive factor for EGFR inhibition, some patients with EGFR wild-type also respond.  The authors investigated whether phosphorylated EGFR could be a potential predictive biomarker in patients with wild-type EGFR. Phosphorylation of Y1068 (assessed by IHC) was associated with improved progression free survival (PFS) in 205 patients with stage IIb and IV NSCLC treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib or erlotinib) compared to phospho-Y1068 negative patients (median PFS 7.0 months vs. 1.2 months, P < 0.001). In this group, 92 (44.9%) were EGFR mutant. In a subgroup of patients with wild-type EGFR, phospho-Y1068 expression positive patients had a significantly prolonged PFS (4.2 months vs.1.2 months P < 0.001) compared with those without phospho-Y1068 expression.
250	TYMS	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Pemetrexed	Resistance	mRNA levels of TYMS, DHFR and GARFT were assessed (rt-PCR) in 50 patient samples of NSCLC. TYMS mRNA levels were lower in responders compared to non-responders to pemetrexed (1.671 ± 0.844 versus 5.978 ± 1.895, p=0.0142).
249	TUBB3	EXPRESSION	B	Taxane Compound	Sensitivity/Response	High expression of betaIII-tubulin, as assessed in 85 breast cancers by IHC, was associated with better pathological response.
1127	ABL1	TKD MUTATION	B	Dasatinib	Resistance	This is a retrospective study of imatinib-resistant (n = 805) or -intolerant (n = 238), chronic myeloid leukemia (chronic-phase), patients with mutations in the BCR-ABL gene fusion kinase domain from the START-C, START-R, and CA180-034 trials. With dasatinib monotherapy, imatinib-resistant patients with and without ABL1 mutation  had comparable complete hematologic response [CHR= 90% (345/384) vs. 93% (390/421)], major cytogenetic response [MCyR= 56% (211/384) vs. 58% (243/421)], complete cytogenetic response [CCyR= 43% (164/384) vs. 47% (196/421)], and major molecular response [MMR= 31% (115/367) vs. 36% (145/404)]. Of the 63 imatinib-resistant variants observed (see comment), the authors associate T315I, F317L, and V299L with resistance to dasatinib or lower levels of response due to clinical resistance and low in vitro sensitivity. However, F317L does have a high CHR. They suggest considering alternative treatment options for patients with these three variants.
1128	PTEN	LOSS	B	Cetuximab	Resistance	In this study, 81 metastatic colorectal cancer patients were treated with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab or panitumumab). Multivariate analysis demonstrated a significant association between PTEN protein expression loss and lack of response to panitumumab or cetuximab (P = 0.0012). Patients with PTEN non-expressing tumors (32/80) had shorter overall survival, compared to those with PTEN expressing tumors (P = 0.0048), though they had a nonsignificant difference in progression free survival (p = .0681).  PIK3CA, PTEN, and KRAS were evaluated for mutations; PTEN loss was the only variant noted in 17 of the patients who experienced either stable disease or disease progression, while the other patients experienced PTEN loss in combination with a KRAS or PIK3CA mutation.
246	HSPA5	EXPRESSION	B	Fluorouracil	Sensitivity/Response	Expression of GRP78 (HSPA5) in colorectal cancer patients (n=396, by IHC) showed improved benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in stage III patients (52% vs. 28%; p = 0.026). In vitro, GRP78 inhibition reduced response to 5-FU.
1129	PTEN	LOSS	B	Panitumumab	Resistance	In this study, 81 metastatic colorectal cancer patients were treated with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab or panitumumab). Multivariate analysis demonstrated a significant association between PTEN protein expression loss and lack of response to panitumumab or cetuximab (P = 0.0012). Patients with PTEN non-expressing tumors (32/80) had shorter overall survival, compared to those with PTEN expressing tumors (P = 0.0048), though they had a nonsignificant difference in progression free survival (p = .0681).  PIK3CA, PTEN, and KRAS were evaluated for mutations; PTEN loss was the only variant noted in 17 of the patients who experienced either stable disease or disease progression, while the other patients experienced PTEN loss in combination with a KRAS or PIK3CA mutation.
244	TOP1	EXPRESSION	B	Irinotecan	Sensitivity/Response	498 patients were retrospectively analyzed for topoisomerase 1 expression (IHC). In the subgroup of patients treated with irinotecan (38% of the 498), those patients expressing Topoisomerase I had a better overall survival according to multivariate analysis (HR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.23-0.94, p = 0.033).
243	EGFR	AMPLIFICATION	B	Cetuximab	Sensitivity/Response	87 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab were retrospectively analyzed for EGFR amplifications by FISH. In multivariate analysis, EGFR amplification predicted response and overall survival independent of KRAS status.
242	TOP1	EXPRESSION	B	Topotecan	Sensitivity/Response	Shorter progression free survival was observed in patients with low expression (IHC) of topoisomerase 1 in 16 patients with relapsed or persistent ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma after treatment with topotecan, cyclophosphamide and carboplatin followed by an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
241	TOP1	EXPRESSION	B	Cyclophosphamide	Sensitivity/Response	Shorter progression free survival was observed in patients with low expression (IHC) of topoisomerase 1 in 16 patients with relapsed or persistent ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma after treatment with topotecan, cyclophosphamide and carboplatin followed by an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
252	EGFR	Y1092 PHOSPHORYLATION	B	Gefitinib	Sensitivity/Response	While EGFR mutation is a strong predictive factor for EGFR inhibition, some patients with EGFR wild-type also respond.  The authors investigated whether phosphorylated EGFR could be a potential predictive biomarker in patients with wild-type EGFR. Phosphorylation of Y1068 (assessed by IHC) was associated with improved progression free survival (PFS) in 205 patients with stage IIb and IV NSCLC treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib or erlotinib) compared to phospho-Y1068 negative patients (median PFS 7.0 months vs. 1.2 months, P < 0.001). In this group, 92 (44.9%) were EGFR mutant. In a subgroup of patients with wild-type EGFR, phospho-Y1068 expression positive patients had a significantly prolonged PFS (4.2 months vs.1.2 months P < 0.001) compared with those without phospho-Y1068 expression.
240	TOP1	EXPRESSION	B	Carboplatin	Sensitivity/Response	Shorter progression free survival was observed in patients with low expression (IHC) of topoisomerase 1 in 16 patients with relapsed or persistent ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma after treatment with topotecan, cyclophosphamide and carboplatin followed by an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
1131	ABL1	TKD MUTATION	B	Bosutinib	Resistance	In this retrospective study, imatinib-resistant or -intolerant patients, with chronic phase CML and BCR-ABL fusions, were treated with bosutanib monotherapy. Among 115 patients with mutational analysis at baseline, subsets were evaluated for complete hematologic response (CHR) and major cytogenetic response (MCyR). Both were comparable for patients with Abl1 mutation versus without [CHR = 33/34 vs. 27/27; MCyR = 41/59 (69%) vs. 19/35 (54%)]. The authors conclude that bosutanib is effective across all BCR-ABL mutations observed except T315I.
237	TYMS	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Pemetrexed	Sensitivity/Response	49 tumor specimens from 268 NSCLC patients treated with pemetrexed were evaluated for expression of TYMS and DHFR by IHC and compared to treatment outcomes. Patients with low TS (≤150) expression had a longer median progression-free survival (PFS) than those with high TS (>150) expression (4.8 vs. 3.4 months; p=0.01).
236	TP53	WILDTYPE	B	Chemotherapy	Sensitivity/Response	Patients with p53 wild type (as defined by low expression and/or wild-type tp53 gene) had a higher response rate to chemotherapy-based treatment (total major response [MR]: risk ratio [RR] = 1.09, 95 % CI = 1.03-1.16, P = .003; pathological MR: RR = 1.15, 95 % CI = 1.06-1.25, P = .001; total complete response [CR]: RR = 1.08, 95 % CI = 1.00-1.17, P = .040) in this meta-analysis (28 studies, 1497 cases).
235	EPHB4	EXPRESSION	B	Bevacizumab	Resistance	EPHB4 expression, as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR in 13 colorectal cancer patients treated with bevacizumab, was higher in non-responders (p = 0.048). No difference was observed in a control group without bevacizumab treatment. qRT-PCR results were also shown to correlate with protein expression measured by IHC.
1132	ABL1	P-LOOP MUTATION	B	Bosutinib	Resistance	In this retrospective study, imatinib-resistant or -intolerant patients, with chronic phase CML and BCR-ABL fusions, were treated with bosutanib monotherapy. Among 115 patients with mutational analysis at baseline, subsets were evaluated for complete hematologic response (CHR) and major cytogenetic response (MCyR). Both were comparable for patients with P-loop mutations versus patients without Abl1 mutations [ CHR = 9/9 vs. 27/27; MCyR = 7/10 vs. 19/35 (54%)]. The authors conclude that bosutanib is effective across all BCR-ABL mutations observed except T315I.
1314	RET	FUSION	B	Selpercatinib	Sensitivity/Response	Patients with RET-fusion positive non-small cell lung cancer were enrolled in this phase 1-2 trial of RET inhibitor selpercatinib. Among 105 consecutively enrolled patients who had previously received at least platinum-based chemotherapy, the percentage with an objective response was 64% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54 to 73). The median duration of response was 17.5 months (95% CI, 12.0 to could not be evaluated), and 63% of the responses were ongoing at a median follow-up of 12.1 months. Among 39 previously untreated patients, the percentage with an objective response was 85% (95% CI, 70 to 94), and 90% of the responses were ongoing at 6 months. Among 11 patients with measurable central nervous system metastasis at enrollment, the percentage with an objective intracranial response was 91% (95% CI, 59 to 100).
1133	ABL1	NON-P-LOOP MUTATION	B	Bosutinib	Resistance	In this retrospective study, imatinib-resistant or -intolerant patients, with chronic phase CML and BCR-ABL fusions, were treated with bosutanib monotherapy. Among 115 patients with mutational analysis at baseline, subsets were evaluated for complete hematologic response (CHR) and major cytogenetic response (MCyR). Both were comparable for patients with non-P-loop mutations versus patient without Abl1 mutations [ CHR = 22/23 (96%) vs. 27/27; MCyR = 26/39 (67%) vs. 19/35 (54%)]. The authors conclude that bosutanib is effective across all BCR-ABL mutations observed except T315I.
1330	RRM1	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Carboplatin	Sensitivity/Response	As part of a randomized phase III trial (USO-03012) in advanced NSCLC of gemcitabine vs. combination gemcitabine and carboplatin, protein expression levels for RRM1 (n=69) and ERCC1 (n=65) were evaluated using fluorescence-based IHC. RRM1 levels were significantly inversely correlated with response (r = −0.41; P = .001, n=58), as were ERCC1 levels (r = −0.39; P = .003, n=55). RRM1 and ERCC1 levels were correlated with each other (r = 0.36; P = .003, n=65). There was no significant interaction with treatment arm (P = .64 for RRM1; P = .79 for ERCC1). The authors conclude that RRM1 and ERCC1 expression levels are predictive of response to gemcitabine, and gemcitabine and carboplatin.
1329	ERCC1	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Gemcitabine	Sensitivity/Response	As part of a randomized phase III trial (USO-03012) in advanced NSCLC of gemcitabine vs. combination gemcitabine and carboplatin, protein expression levels for RRM1 (n=69) and ERCC1 (n=65) were evaluated using fluorescence-based IHC. RRM1 levels were significantly inversely correlated with response (r = −0.41; P = .001, n=58), as were ERCC1 levels (r = −0.39; P = .003, n=55). RRM1 and ERCC1 levels were correlated with each other (r = 0.36; P = .003, n=65). There was no significant interaction with treatment arm (P = .64 for RRM1; P = .79 for ERCC1). The authors conclude that RRM1 and ERCC1 expression levels are predictive of response to gemcitabine, and gemcitabine and carboplatin.
1134	ABL1	TKD MUTATION	B	Nilotinib	Resistance	In this open-label, phase II registration trial, patients that were imatinib resistant (n = 192) or intolerant (n = 89) underwent nilotinib monotherapy. Prior to nilotinib treatment, 105 and 9 patients with baseline BCR-ABL mutations were imatinib resistant and intolerant, respectively. Within 12 months of therapy, among patients with baseline mutations, complete hematologic response was achieved in 57 (71%) of 80 [vs. 35 (80%) of 80 Abl1 wildtype patients, P = .393], major cytogenetic response in 49 of 100 [vs. 52 (60%) of 87, P = .145], complete cytogenetic response in 32 of 100 [vs. 35 (40%) of 87, P = .285], and major molecular response in 19 (22%) of 87 [vs. 22 (29%) of 76, P = .366]. These data shows no significant difference in nilotinib efficacy between patients with baseline mutations in the Abl1 kinase domain versus without. The authors observe clinical efficacy of nilotinib for many of the 29 variants found and identify only Y253H, E255K/V, and F359C/V as resistance conferring variants with IC50 greater than 150 nM. Individuals with T315I variants (3% of total population) were excluded.
1328	ERCC1	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Carboplatin	Sensitivity/Response	As part of a randomized phase III trial (USO-03012) in advanced NSCLC of gemcitabine vs. combination gemcitabine and carboplatin, protein expression levels for RRM1 (n=69) and ERCC1 (n=65) were evaluated using fluorescence-based IHC. RRM1 levels were significantly inversely correlated with response (r = −0.41; P = .001, n=58), as were ERCC1 levels (r = −0.39; P = .003, n=55). RRM1 and ERCC1 levels were correlated with each other (r = 0.36; P = .003, n=65). There was no significant interaction with treatment arm (P = .64 for RRM1; P = .79 for ERCC1). The authors conclude that RRM1 and ERCC1 expression levels are predictive of response to gemcitabine, and gemcitabine and carboplatin.
239	TOP2A	EXPRESSION	B	Doxorubicin	Sensitivity/Response	In a retrospective study, TOP2A expression was assessed by IHC for 108 breast cancer patients (from TAX 303 trial). TOP2A expression was associated with a higher probability of response in doxorubicin treated but not in docetaxel treated breast cancer patients.
253	IGF1R	NUCLEAR EXPRESSION	B	IGF1R Monoclonal Antibody	Sensitivity/Response	IGF-1R nuclear immunostaining (IHC) was observed in 9 out of 16 samples of patients with different sarcomas (osteosarcoma, ewing sarcoma, liposarcoma, synovialsarcoma, desmoplastic tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma). Exclusive nuclear immunostaining was associated with better progression free survival and overall survival after therapy with IGF1R antibodies (R1507, IMC-A12, SCH 717454 and CP-751.871).
1126	ABL1	BCR::ABL E459K	B	Dasatinib	Resistance	This is a retrospective study of imatinib-resistant (n = 805) or -intolerant (n = 238), chronic myeloid leukemia (chronic-phase), patients with mutations in the BCR-ABL gene fusion kinase domain from the START-C, START-R, and CA180-034 trials. With dasatinib monotherapy, patients with and without ABL1 mutation had comparable complete hematologic response (CHR), major cytogenetic response (MCyR), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), and major molecular response (MMR). Out of 12 patients with the E459K mutations, 4, 6, and 11 achieved CCyR, MCyR, and CHR with dasatinib monotherapy, respectively. Analyses by variant included patients with multiple kinase domain mutations.
255	PROM1	EXPRESSION	B	Sorafenib	Resistance	CD133 (PROM1) expression in 39 samples of hepatocellular carcinomas was correlated with JNK activity. Both were more highly expressed in patients not responding to sorafenib. CD133+ cells (sorted) were xenografted into mice, producing larger, more JNK inhibitor responsive tumors than CD133- xenografts.
1336	SSTR5	EXPRESSION	B	Pasireotide	Sensitivity/Response	Phase II study of pasireotide in metastatic neuroendocrine tumours enrolled 29 patients. Overall median PFS was 11 months (95% CI, 7.6–16 months). High SSTR5 expression (seen in 17/22 samples measured) was associated with prolonged PFS (P=0.0068). Median PFS for low-SSTR5 tumours was 2.8 months (95% CI, 2.3–12.1 months) vs high tumours 19.9 months (95% CI, 7.7–29.1 months).
2	FLT3	ITD	B	Tretinoin	Resistance	ATRA treatment did not effect overall survival in patients <60 years old with FLT3-ITD mutation.
1335	KIT	EXPRESSION	B	Sunitinib	Sensitivity/Response	Phase II trial of sunitinib in 40 patients with first recurrence of primary glioblastoma. Median PFS 2.2 mo, median OS 9.2 mo, 5 stable disease >=6 months, no objective responses, so primary study endpoint was not met. However, IHC of multiple receptor kinases was performed, and protein expression of KIT in vascular endothelial cells was associated with longer PFS (P = .017; HR, 2.564; 95% CI, 1.180–5.570). All 5 with stable disease were KIT+ in vascular endothelial cells. Note KIT staining was not observed in tumour cells. No association with OS.
275	CXCR4	EXPRESSION	B	Docetaxel	Resistance	CXCR4 expression as assessed by microarray analysis, was associated with resistance to docetaxel in 11 cancer cell lines (R^2 = 0.23, p = 0.019). Expression levels (by qtPCR) were also higher in resistant tumors among 25 patient samples.
274	EGFR	AMPLIFICATION	B	Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor	Sensitivity/Response	A meta-analysis of EGFR gene copy number as a predictive biomarker for patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment was performed. In total, 20 (1689 patients, 594 with increased gene copy number), 10 (822 patients, 290 with increased gene copy number) and 5 studies (294 patients, 129 with increased gene copy number) were analyzed for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and time-to-progression (TTP) meta-analyses respectively. EGFR amplification was associated with increased OS (HR = 0.77; 95% CI 0.66-0.89; P = 0.001), PFS (HR = 0.60; 95% CI 0.46-0.79; P<0.001) and TTP (HR = 0.50; 95% CI 0.28-0.91; P = 0.02). This effect was shown to influence survival in predominantly white patient populations but not patients of Asian descent.
273	DNMT1	EXPRESSION	B	Cisplatin	Resistance	High DNMT1 expression was found in 105/127 (83%) or patients (by qPCR assay). Low DNMT1 expression was associated with improved histopathological and clinical response and OS in patients with gastric cancer  (P=0.03/P=0.008, P(log-rank)=0.001, respectively). In one cisplatin resistant cell line, DAC treatment and cisplatin had a synergistic effect.
272	ALK	FUSION	B	Pemetrexed	Sensitivity/Response	Among 95 patients with NSCLC in this study, 15 had an ALK translocation. ORR of these patients compared to EGFR mutated or wild-type tumors was superior (46.7 versus 4.7 versus 16.2%, p = 0.001). TYMS expression was lower in ALK-positive cells.
1333	ERCC1	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Platinum Compound	Sensitivity/Response	Ovarian epithelial tumours (n=235) were used to create TMAs and IHC results were scored for ERCC1 (n=114 low, n=121 high). For platinum sensitive patients (n=250 in supplementary table, but not all have ERCC1 levels available), low ERCC1 was associated with better PFS (p = 0.034, HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.6). For platinum resistant patients (n=26 in supplementary table, but not all have ERCC1 levels available), there was no significant association (p = 0.550, HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.1-4.3).
270	BRCA1	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Taxane Compound	Sensitivity/Response	Absent/low expression of BRCA1 (IHC) was associated with improved response to chemotherapy in 292 patients with sporadic ovarian cancer compared to patients with high expression (odds ratio 2.47: 95%CI 1.10-5.55, p=0.029).
269	BRCA1	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Platinum Compound	Sensitivity/Response	Absent/low expression of BRCA1 (IHC) was associated with improved response to chemotherapy in 292 patients with sporadic ovarian cancer compared to patients with high expression (odds ratio 2.47: 95%CI 1.10-5.55, p=0.029).
1332	SLC29A1	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Gemcitabine	Sensitivity/Response	Surgically resected PDACs were used to create tissue microarrays, which were scored for antibody staining of hENT1 (SLC29A1). For patients treated with gemcitabine (n=243), high levels of hENT1 were associated with longer survival time in Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.29-0.63, P < .0001) and by multivariate proportional hazards model (HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.22-0.53, P < .0001). For patients treated with surgery alone (n=142), there was no association with survival.
7	TSC1	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	B	Everolimus	Sensitivity/Response	Tumors expressing TSC1 or TSC2 mutations show notably more sensitivity to everolimus than their wild-type counterparts.
8	BRCA1	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	B	Olaparib	Sensitivity/Response	The combination of PARP inhibition (Olaparib) with BRCA mutation results in irreparable and lethal DNA damage. Response rates are higher in BRCA1 mutation positive women with high grade serous or undifferentiated ovarian cancer.
9	BRCA2	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	B	Olaparib	Sensitivity/Response	The combination of PARP inhibition (Olaparib) with BRCA mutation results in irreparable and lethal DNA damage. Response rates are higher in BRCA2 mutation positive women with high grade serous or undifferentiated ovarian cancer.
1331	RRM1	UNDEREXPRESSION	B	Gemcitabine	Sensitivity/Response	As part of a randomized phase III trial (USO-03012) in advanced NSCLC of gemcitabine vs. combination gemcitabine and carboplatin, protein expression levels for RRM1 (n=69) and ERCC1 (n=65) were evaluated using fluorescence-based IHC. RRM1 levels were significantly inversely correlated with response (r = −0.41; P = .001, n=58), as were ERCC1 levels (r = −0.39; P = .003, n=55). RRM1 and ERCC1 levels were correlated with each other (r = 0.36; P = .003, n=65). There was no significant interaction with treatment arm (P = .64 for RRM1; P = .79 for ERCC1). The authors conclude that RRM1 and ERCC1 expression levels are predictive of response to gemcitabine, and gemcitabine and carboplatin.
1109	BRAF	V600E and Amplification	B	Vemurafenib	Resistance	In a retrospective study of 44 relapsed melanoma patients harboring BRAF V600E or V600K (known BRAF inhibitor sensitizing mutations), MAPK pathway reactivation mechanisms were implicated in acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib or dabrafenib) monotherapy. The following MAPK pathway variants were found in progressive tumors with patient matched baseline tumors (some patients donated samples from multiple geographically/temporally distinct progressive tumors): NRAS mutations (G12D, G12R, G13R, Q61K, Q61R, Q61L) in 13/71 (18%) of progressive tumors, KRAS mutations (G12C, G12R, Q61H) in 5/71 (7%) of progressive tumors, mutant BRAF amplification (2-15 fold or 4-75 copies) in 11/57 (19%) of progressive tumors, mutant BRAF alternative splice variants (novel exon boundaries between 1/9, 1/11, 3/9) in 6/48 (13%) of progressive tumor RNA.

The following MAPK pathway variants were found in progressive tumors with patient matched baseline tumors (some patients donated samples from multiple geographically/temporally distinct progressive tumors): NRAS mutations (G12D, G12R, G13R, Q61K, Q61R, Q61L) in 13/71 (18%) of progressive tumors, KRAS mutations (G12C, G12R, Q61H) in 5/71 (7%) of progressive tumors, mutant BRAF amplification (2-15 fold or 4-75 copies) in 11/57 (19%) of progressive tumors, mutant BRAF alternative splice variants (novel exon boundaries between 1/9, 1/11, 3/9) in 6/48 (13%) of progressive tumor RNA.
1112	BRAF	K AND AMPLIFICATION	B	Dabrafenib	Resistance	In a retrospective study of 44 relapsed melanoma patients harboring BRAF V600E or V600K (known BRAF inhibitor sensitizing mutations), MAPK pathway reactivation mechanisms were implicated in acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib or dabrafenib) monotherapy. The following MAPK pathway variants were found in progressive tumors with patient matched baseline tumors (some patients donated samples from multiple geographically/temporally distinct progressive tumors): NRAS mutations (G12D, G12R, G13R, Q61K, Q61R, Q61L) in 13/71 (18%) of progressive tumors, KRAS mutations (G12C, G12R, Q61H) in 5/71 (7%) of progressive tumors, mutant BRAF amplification (2-15 fold or 4-75 copies) in 11/57 (19%) of progressive tumors, mutant BRAF alternative splice variants (novel exon boundaries between 1/9, 1/11, 3/9) in 6/48 (13%) of progressive tumor RNA.
11	ABL1	BCR::ABL T315I	B	Imatinib	Resistance	In chronic myeloid leukemia patients with the ABL T315I mutation, tumors have shown to be resistant to imatinib treatment.
1124	ABL1	BCR::ABL L248V	B	Dasatinib	Resistance	This is a retrospective study of imatinib-resistant (n = 805) or -intolerant (n = 238), chronic myeloid leukemia (chronic-phase), patients with mutations in the BCR-ABL gene fusion kinase domain from the START-C, START-R, and CA180-034 trials. With dasatinib monotherapy, patients with and without ABL1 mutation had comparable complete hematologic response (CHR), major cytogenetic response (MCyR), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), and major molecular response (MMR). Out of 15 patients with L248V mutations, 6, 10, and 15 achieved CCyR, MCyR, and CHR with dasatinib monotherapy, respectively. Analyses by variant included patients with multiple kinase domain mutations.
1125	ABL1	BCR::ABL F317L	B	Dasatinib	Resistance	This is a retrospective study of imatinib-resistant (n = 805) or -intolerant (n = 238), chronic myeloid leukemia (chronic-phase) patients with mutations in the BCR-ABL gene fusion kinase domain from the START-C, START-R, and CA180-034 trials. With dasatinib monotherapy, patients with and without ABL1 mutation  had comparable complete hematologic response (CHR), major cytogenetic response (MCyR), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), and major molecular response (MMR). Out of 14 patients with F317L mutations, 1, 2, and 13 achieved CCyR, MCyR, and CHR to dasatinib monotherapy, respectively. Analyses by variant included patients with multiple kinase domain mutations. Despite high CHR in patients with the F317L variant, of the 63 variants considered, the authors associate T315I, F317L, and V299L with resistance or lower levels of response to dasatinib due to clinical resistance and low in vitro sensitivity. They suggest considering alternative treatment options for patients with these three variants.
258	TYMS	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Raltitrexed	Resistance	In 125 gastric tumors, plasma and tissue mRNA levels of TYMS were lower in the raltitrexed sensitive group compared to the resistant group (p = 0.007 and 0.013, respectively).
257	FOXP3	EXPRESSION	B	Epirubicin	Sensitivity/Response	1,097 patients with breast cancer were evaluated for FOXP3 expression by IHC. FOXP3 expression was found in 405 tumor samples and associated with improved OS in patients treated with anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy (6 cycles of 'FEC100' aka epirubicin + cyclophosphamide + 5-fluorouracil) but not in patients treated with sequential anthracycline->taxane (3 cycles of FEC100 followed by 3 cycles of docetaxel). In-vitro experiments confirmed that FOXP3 expression enhance anthracycline efficacy. The in vitro data consisted of testing the sensitivity of various breast cancer cell lines to anthracyclines after treatment with valproic acid (which increases FOXP3 expression). The authors observed that, while valproic acid has no intrinsic cytotoxic effect on tumor cells, it enhanced the cytotoxic effect of epirubicin specifically in cell lines where FOXP3 expression was increased.
256	TIMP1	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Paclitaxel	Resistance	High expression of TIMP-1 was assessed by IHC in 99 primary breast cancers that had not spread beyond the breast after 6 postoperative courses of paclitaxel-based chemotherapy. High TIMP1 levels were associated with worse 5-year disease free survival (71.1%) than low levels (88.5 %; P = 0.020). High TIMP-1 levels were also associated with worse 5-year overall survival (78.9 %) than low levels (96.7 %; P = 0.004).
1135	BRAF	INTRON 10 REARRANGEMENT	B	Vemurafenib	Resistance	In a retrospective study of 44 relapsed melanoma patients harboring BRAF V600E or V600K (known BRAF inhibitor sensitizing mutations), MAPK pathway reactivation mechanisms were implicated in acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib or dabrafenib) monotherapy. The following MAPK pathway variants were found in progressive tumors with patient matched baseline tumors (some patients donated samples from multiple geographically/temporally distinct progressive tumors): NRAS mutations (G12D, G12R, G13R, Q61K, Q61R, Q61L) in 13/71 (18%) of progressive tumors, KRAS mutations (G12C, G12R, Q61H) in 5/71 (7%) of progressive tumors, mutant BRAF amplification (2-15 fold or 4-75 copies) in 11/57 (19%) of progressive tumors, mutant BRAF alternative splice variants (novel exon boundaries between 1/9, 1/11, 3/9) in 6/48 (13%) of progressive tumor RNA.
1136	BRAF	INTRON 10 REARRANGEMENT	B	Dabrafenib	Resistance	In a retrospective study of 44 relapsed melanoma patients harboring BRAF V600E or V600K (known BRAF inhibitor sensitizing mutations), MAPK pathway reactivation mechanisms were implicated in acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib or dabrafenib) monotherapy. The following MAPK pathway variants were found in progressive tumors with patient matched baseline tumors (some patients donated samples from multiple geographically/temporally distinct progressive tumors): NRAS mutations (G12D, G12R, G13R, Q61K, Q61R, Q61L) in 13/71 (18%) of progressive tumors, KRAS mutations (G12C, G12R, Q61H) in 5/71 (7%) of progressive tumors, mutant BRAF amplification (2-15 fold or 4-75 copies) in 11/57 (19%) of progressive tumors, mutant BRAF alternative splice variants (novel exon boundaries between 1/9, 1/11, 3/9) in 6/48 (13%) of progressive tumor RNA.
1207	CDKN2A	LOSS	B	Palbociclib	Resistance	TAPUR, a phase II basket trial, included a cohort of patients with advanced non-small lung cell carcinoma (NSCLC) harboring with CDKN2A loss or mutation and no RB mutations. Twenty-nine patients were treated with CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib; one experienced a partial response and 6 experienced stable disease lasting longer than 16 weeks (disease control rate: 29%). Median PFS was 7.9 weeks and median OS was 20.6 weeks. Authors concluded that palbociclib is worthy of further study in advanced NSCLC when standard treatment options aren't available.
213	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Afatinib	Sensitivity/Response	In this phase 2 trial, treatment-naive, ERBB2-positive (by IHC) breast cancer patients with stage IIIA, B, C or inflammatory disease were randomized 1:1:1 to afatinib (n = 10), lapatinib (n = 8), or trastuzumab (n = 11). The primary end point was objective response rate. Objective response was seen in 8 afatinib-, 6 lapatinib-, and 4 trastuzumab-treated patients. Afatinib demonstrated clinical activity that compared favorably to trastuzumab and lapatinib for neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.
1327	IGF1R	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Metformin	Sensitivity/Response	A randomized phase III trial of hormone sensitive (ER or PR positive) early stage breast cancer (Dutch TEAM cohort, n=2,446) examined the addition of metformin to exemestane for 155 patients. IGF1R IHC was performed and patients classified as IGF1R high (n=105) or low (n=50). In IGF1R-high patients, combining metformin with exemestane was associated with significant RFS (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.57–2.23 for sequential treatment with metformin, HR 0.73 95% CI 0.56–0.94 for exemestane only, and HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.10–1.00 for exemestane with metformin, p = 0.02, compared to the sequential treatment arm). There was also significant association with OS (HR for OS 1.72, 95% CI 0.96–3.08 for sequential treatment with metformin, HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62–1.03 for exemestane only, and HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.31–1.45 for exemestane with metformin, p = 0.03, compared to the sequential treatment arm). The authors conclude that adding metformin to exemestane for patients with IGF1R-high expression may have clinical benefit.
223	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Cetuximab	Resistance	141 patients were analyzed for ERBB2 (HER2) positivity by FISH and/or IHC. Only 6 (4.3%) were ERBB2 positive. These patients did not show a difference in outcome after capecitabine, oxaliplatin and chemoradiotherapy, with or without cetuximab.
222	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Capecitabine	Resistance	141 patients were analyzed for ERBB2 (HER2) positivity by FISH and/or IHC. Only 6 (4.3%) were ERBB2 positive. These patients did not show a difference in outcome after capecitabine, oxaliplatin and chemoradiotherapy, with or without cetuximab.

221	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Oxaliplatin	Resistance	141 patients were analyzed for ERBB2 (HER2) positivity by FISH and/or IHC. Only 6 (4.3%) were ERBB2 positive. These patients did not show a difference in outcome after capecitabine, oxaliplatin and chemoradiotherapy, with or without cetuximab.
203	BIRC5	NUCLEAR EXPRESSION	B	Platinum Compound	Sensitivity/Response	Patients with nuclear survivin (BIRC5) expression had significantly better responses to taxane-platinum chemotherapy than those with low tumor N-survivin expression (P < 0.001) in a retrospective analysis of 48 patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
220	PTEN	LOSS	B	Temsirolimus	Resistance	94 endometrial cancer samples of women who had been treated with single agent mTOR inhibitors temsirolimus or ridaforolimus were retrospectively analyzed. No predictive biomarkers were identified, including PIK3CA mutations, KRAS mutations or PTEN loss.
219	PTEN	LOSS	B	Ridaforolimus	Resistance	94 endometrial cancer samples of women who had been treated with single agent mTOR inhibitors temsirolimus or ridaforolimus were retrospectively analyzed. No predictive biomarkers were identified, including PIK3CA mutations, KRAS mutations or PTEN loss.
218	AGR2	EXPRESSION	B	Tamoxifen	Resistance	mRNA expression of AGR2 in 61 patients with tamoxifen treated postmenopausal breast cancer was determined by qRT-PCR and was inversely associated with treatment response and progression free survival (p= 0.0011, p = 0.0366 respectively). AGR2 protein expression as assessed by IHC was not significantly associated with treatment outcome.
204	BIRC5	NUCLEAR EXPRESSION	B	Taxane Compound	Sensitivity/Response	Patients with nuclear survivin (BIRC5) expression had significantly better responses to taxane-platinum chemotherapy than those with low tumor N-survivin expression (P < 0.001) in a retrospective analysis of 48 patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

205	TP53	WILDTYPE	B	Cetuximab	Sensitivity/Response	In this retrospective biomarker analysis of the EXPERT-C trial, patients with TP53 wild-type status had a statistically significant better progression free survival (PFS) (89.3% vs 65.0% at 5 years; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.07 to 0.78; two-sided P = .02 by Cox regression) and overall survival (OS) (92.7% vs 67.5% at 5 years; HR = 0.16; 95% CI = 0.04 to 0.70; two-sided P = .02 by Cox regression) when treated with Cetuximab + CAPOX (Capecitabine, Oxaliplatin) than in the control arm without Cetuximab.
206	TP53	WILDTYPE	B	Oxaliplatin	Sensitivity/Response	In this retrospective biomarker analysis of the EXPERT-C trial, patients with TP53 wild-type status had a statistically significant better progression free survival (PFS) (89.3% vs 65.0% at 5 years; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.07 to 0.78; two-sided P = .02 by Cox regression) and overall survival (OS) (92.7% vs 67.5% at 5 years; HR = 0.16; 95% CI = 0.04 to 0.70; two-sided P = .02 by Cox regression) when treated with Cetuximab + CAPOX (Capecitabine, Oxaliplatin) than in the control arm without Cetuximab.
214	TOP1	AMPLIFICATION	B	Irinotecan	Sensitivity/Response	FFPE tumor samples from 78 patients with colorectal cancer, who had received irinotecan monotherapy were analyzed with a FISH dual-probe. TOP1 gain was nonsignificantly associated with objective response to irinotecan Odds ratio (OR): 1.62; p = 0.07.
212	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Lapatinib	Sensitivity/Response	In this phase 2 trial, treatment-naive, ERBB2-positive (by IHC) breast cancer patients with stage IIIA, B, C or inflammatory disease were randomized 1:1:1 to afatinib (n = 10), lapatinib (n = 8), or trastuzumab (n = 11). The primary end point was objective response rate. Objective response was seen in 8 afatinib-, 6 lapatinib-, and 4 trastuzumab-treated patients. Afatinib demonstrated clinical activity that compared favorably to trastuzumab and lapatinib for neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.
211	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	B	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	In this phase 2 trial, treatment-naive, ERBB2-positive (by IHC) breast cancer patients with stage IIIA, B, C or inflammatory disease were randomized 1:1:1 to afatinib (n = 10), lapatinib (n = 8), or trastuzumab (n = 11). The primary end point was objective response rate. Objective response was seen in 8 afatinib-, 6 lapatinib-, and 4 trastuzumab-treated patients.

15	FLT3	TKD MUTATION	B	Sorafenib	Resistance	Emergence of D835 mutation in AML patients with FLT3 tandem repeat is associated with sorafenib resistance.
207	TP53	WILDTYPE	B	Capecitabine	Sensitivity/Response	In this retrospective biomarker analysis of the EXPERT-C trial, patients with TP53 wild-type status had a statistically significant better progression free survival (PFS) (89.3% vs 65.0% at 5 years; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.07 to 0.78; two-sided P = .02 by Cox regression) and overall survival (OS) (92.7% vs 67.5% at 5 years; HR = 0.16; 95% CI = 0.04 to 0.70; two-sided P = .02 by Cox regression) when treated with Cetuximab + CAPOX (Capecitabine, Oxaliplatin) than in the control arm without Cetuximab.
1141	NTRK1	FUSION	B	Larotrectinib	Sensitivity/Response	In a Phase 1/2 study involving 15 pediatric patients with infantile fibrosarcoma or soft tissue sarcoma, 8 patients had NTRK1 fusions. The patients were administered Larotrectinib, and 7 out of 8 patients showed objective response, with 2 complete and 5 partial responses. The patient without objective response had soft tissue sarcoma, and showed stable disease.
1326	IGF1R	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Exemestane	Sensitivity/Response	A randomized phase III trial of hormone sensitive (ER or PR positive) early stage breast cancer (Dutch TEAM cohort, n=2,446) examined the addition of metformin to exemestane for 155 patients. IGF1R IHC was performed and patients classified as IGF1R high (n=105) or low (n=50). In IGF1R-high patients, combining metformin with exemestane was associated with significant RFS (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.57–2.23 for sequential treatment with metformin, HR 0.73 95% CI 0.56–0.94 for exemestane only, and HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.10–1.00 for exemestane with metformin, p = 0.02, compared to the sequential treatment arm). There was also significant association with OS (HR for OS 1.72, 95% CI 0.96–3.08 for sequential treatment with metformin, HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62–1.03 for exemestane only, and HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.31–1.45 for exemestane with metformin, p = 0.03, compared to the sequential treatment arm). The authors conclude that adding metformin to exemestane for patients with IGF1R-high expression may have clinical benefit.
202	AURKA	OVEREXPRESSION	B	Cisplatin	Resistance	High levels of Aurora-A expression (retrospectively assessed by IHC in 102 NSCLC patients) predicted poorer overall survival and progression free survival in a population treated with surgery and cisplatin-based chemotherapy. In-vitro data confirmed these results and overexpression or knockdown of AURKA decreased or increased in-vitro sensitivity to cisplatin.
193	PTEN	LOSS	B	Trastuzumab	Resistance	In 48 patients with advanced gastric cancer, retrospectively analyzed for PTEN expression using IHC, PTEN loss was associated with a shorter duration of response (median 4.2 vs. 6.1 months, p = 0.04) to HER2-targeted therapy (trastuzumab, N=39; lapatinib, N=9). Response rates did not differ between groups.

1246	FGFR1	AMPLIFICATION	C	Pazopanib	Sensitivity/Response	Patient diagnosed with metastatic squamous cell lung cancer had high-level amplification of FGFR1 and high expression of MYC.  Patient was treated with 400 mg pazopanib twice a day.  CT taken four and eight weeks after start of pazopanib showed tumor regression and cavitation.   Due to side effects, patient stopped taking pazopanib after 6 months.  No clinical or radiologic signs of tumor progression were present at that time.
694	ALK	ALTERNATIVE TRANSCRIPT (ATI)	C	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	Expression of an alternative ALK transcript (ATI), encompassing exons 20–29 preceded by ~400 base pairs (bp) of intron 19, but not exons 1–19 was identified in three samples of thyroid cancer and melanoma. In TCGA samples, ALK ATI was expressed in approx. 11% of melanoma samples. Functional activity of ALK ATI was shown in-vitro. In vivo studies confirmed oncogenic activity of ALK ATI similar to other ALK mutations or fusions and sensitivity to crizotinib. A patient with metastatic melanoma and ALK ATI expression but no MET or ALK aberrations identified with FISH and a 341-gene panel sequencing  was treated with crizotinib and had symptomatic improvement and tumor shrinkage within 6 weeks of therapy
846	ABL1	BCR::ABL F359V	C	Bosutinib	Resistance	In this retrospective study, imatinib-resistant or -intolerant patients, with chronic phase CML and BCR-ABL fusions, were treated with bosutanib monotherapy. Complete hematologic response (CHR) and major cytogenetic response (MCyR) were comparable for patients with Abl1 mutation versus without. The authors conclude that bosutanib is effective across all BCR-ABL mutations observed except T315I. Of patients with F359V evaluated, 6/6 had complete hematologic responses and 4/7 had major cytogenetic responses.
685	FGFR1	AMPLIFICATION	C	Infigratinib	Sensitivity/Response	Phase 1 study of FGFR-inhibitor BGJ398 in advanced cancer with FGFR-aberrations.

An accelerated-phase (AP) patient improved to chronic phase. M351T, E255K, and F359V variants were each present in ~25% of transcripts beginning at 6, 11, and 14 months, respectively. At 20 months, the patient returned to accelerated phase with an increase in the proportion of E255K variants to ~75% of transcripts. Another AP patient had a complete hematologic response with the M351T variant present in ~25 to ~75% of transcripts and the F359V variant present in ~25% to ~50% of transcripts between 8 and 16 months after therapy initiation but prior to resistance. At 17 months, the patient progressed to myeloid blast crisis and there was cytogenetic evidence of a double Ph-chromosome. At that time, no secondary variants could be detected.
1208	RICTOR	AMPLIFICATION	C	Vistusertib	Sensitivity/Response	In a phase 2 basket trial, patients with small-cell lung carcinoma (SLC) who failed platinum-based chemotherapy and harbored RICTOR amplification were treated with mTOR 1/2 inhibitor vistusertib (AZD2014). Among 4 patients enrolled in this study, no patients showed tumor response or disease control. Progression free survival was 1.25 months, and three patients experienced adverse effects grade 3 or greater. Authors conclude that further development of the tested AZD2014 regimen is not warranted.

The patient treated in a clinical trial with pan-TRK kinase inhibitor entrectinib. Treatment was well tolerated and led to a partial response (PR) with 30% tumor shrinkage of multiple liver metastases. Clinical response lasted 4 months.
715	ABL1	BCR::ABL F359V	C	Imatinib	Resistance	In two cell-based studies, a panel of either 18 or 16 mutations representing 85% of known mutations seen in imatinib CML patents were used to evaluate the effectiveness of drug binding. All mutations were compared with non-mutated BCR-ABL protein and were grouped according to their anti-proliferative activity. Mutant cell lines that exhibited a greater than 4-fold increase in IC50 value were considered resistant to drug, 2-4 fold increase in IC50 were moderately resistant and less than 2-fold change in IC50 was sensitive to drug treatment. The F359V mutation was  moderately resistant to imatinib .
686	FGFR2	FUSION	C	Infigratinib	Sensitivity/Response	Phase 1 study of FGFR-inhibitor BGJ398 (infigratinib) in advanced cancer with FGFR-aberrations (n=132). Two cholangiocarcinoma patients harbored FGFR2 fusions. Both were treated at BGJ398 doses >100mg and saw stable disease. One patient had an unknown FGFR2 fusion partner and saw 20.2% reduction in target lesion size. The other patient harbored FGFR2 BICC1 fusion, and saw a 9.8% reduction in target lesion size.

The patient treated in a clinical trial with pan-TRK kinase inhibitor entrectinib. Treatment was well tolerated and led to a partial response (PR) with 30% tumor shrinkage of multiple liver metastases. Clinical response lasted 4 months. Longitudinal analysis of ctDNA in plasma samples revealed a p.G595R- and p.G667C mutation in NTRK1 that were absent before treatment initiation but  emerged 4 weeks upon initiation of treatment with entrectinib. These mutations were also validated using xenograft, in vitro and 3D-modeling.

All mutations were compared with non-mutated BCR-ABL protein and were grouped according to their anti-proliferative activity. Mutant cell lines that exhibited a greater than 4-fold increase in IC50 value were considered resistant to drug, 2-4 fold increase in IC50 were moderately resistant and less than 2-fold change in IC50 was sensitive to drug treatment. The G250E mutation was  resistant to imatinib .
734	ABL1	BCR::ABL Q252H	C	Imatinib	Resistance	In this study, patients on imatinib monotherapy were monitored for ABL1 kinase domain variants in BCR-ABL1 fusions amplified from peripheral blood RNA. A chronic-phase (CP) patient achieved a complete hematologic response (CHR). The Q252H variant was detected but was absent when the patient progressed to myeloid blast crisis (MBC) with a double Philadelphia chromosome and died. A second CP patient had a partial hematologic response (PHR) with the Q252H and M351T variants. They progressed to MBC and the double Ph-chromosome was later detected without any secondary variants prior to death. The third CP patient had a PHR but became resistant. The Q252H variant was later detected and the patient died in MBC. An accelerated-phase (AP) patient had a CHR but progressed to MBC with the appearance of the Q252H variant. The patient died in MBC after a bone marrow transplant.
729	ABL1	BCR::ABL G250E	C	Imatinib	Resistance	In this study, patients on imatinib monotherapy were monitored for ABL1 kinase domain variants in BCR-ABL1 fusions amplified from peripheral blood RNA. A late-chronic phase (CP) patient had a complete hematologic response (CHR) but acquired resistance 7 months after therapy initiation. At month 11, the L248V, G250E, S417Y, E459K variants were present in approximately 25, 25, 25, and 50% of transcripts, respectively. The patient died in accelerated phase at month 14. An accelerated-phase patient had a CHR but progressed to partial hematologic response concurrent with the appearance of the G250E variant in ~25% of transcripts and the M351T variant in ~50% of transcripts.

1238	DPYD	EXON 11-19 DELETION	C	Leucovorin	Sensitivity/Response	A 69 year old patient diagnosed with HNSCC presented with an unresectable neck mass three months after surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy. A biopsy was taken for whole genome and transcriptome analysis and the patient was started on systemic therapy. After showing resistance to the systemic therapy treatment with 5-FU and leucovorin was initiated based on the discovery of a somatic exon 11-19 in frame deletion in DPYD, which was hypothesized to increase sensitivity to 5-FU in the tumour. A dramatic clinical and radiographic response was sustained for 17 weeks, but following a 3 week treatment break a new nodule appeared. This recurrence showed resistance to re-initiation of treatment with capecitabine (oral 5-FU), and analysis of an additional biopsy provided no evidence as to the mechanism of resistance.
1215	BRAF	AMPLIFICATION	C	Trametinib	Resistance	In a retrospective study, authors analyzed BRAF V600 mutated melanoma metastases derived from 10 patients treated with the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib for resistance mechanisms and genetic correlates of response. An acquired resistance mechanism activating the MAPK pathway was identified in 9 tumors; BRAF amplification (n=4), MEK1/2 mutation (n=3), NRAS mutations (n=3). Among them, mutual exclusive alterations were BRAF amplification (n=4), MEK2 C125S (n=1), and NRAS Q61K (n=2).
724	ABL1	BCR::ABL L248V	C	Imatinib	Resistance	In this study, patients on imatinib monotherapy were monitored for ABL1 kinase domain variants in BCR-ABL1 fusions amplified from peripheral blood RNA. A late-chronic phase (CP) patient had a complete hematologic response but acquired resistance after 7 months of therapy and discontinued imatinib 3 months later. At month 11, the L248V, G250E, S417Y, E459K variants were present in approximately 25, 25, 25, and 50% of transcripts, respectively.

712	EGFR	EX19 DEL L858R	C	Gefitinib	Sensitivity/Response	A phase 2 study of 120 stage IIIB-IV lung adenocarcinoma patients reported improved progression free survival in patients with EGFR mutation (defined as exon 19 deletion or exon 21 mutation) when treated (n=13) with gefitinib and pemetrexed/platinum combination therapy (HR: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.05-0.75, P=0.017) as compared to treatment (n=18) with pemtrexed/platinum alone.  In the subgroup of patients without EGFR mutation (defined as all patients without the specific EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation) a difference in median PFS was not seen between the chemotherapy versus chemotherapy with gefitinib treatment groups.
719	ABL1	BCR::ABL M244V	C	Imatinib	Resistance	In this study, patients on imatinib monotherapy were monitored for ABL1 kinase domain variants in BCR-ABL1 fusions amplified from peripheral blood RNA. A late-chronic phase patient had only a partial hematologic response which improved to a major cytogenetic response after dose escalation 18 months after therapy initiation. At months 7 and 8, the M244V was present in 100% of transcripts. No further testing for secondary variants was performed. At 18 months, 25% of cells were Ph-positive, but this did not meet the authors' threshold for loss of MCR which is >65% Ph-positive cells or an increase of 30%.
1334	NTRK1	AMPLIFICATION	C	Larotrectinib	Sensitivity/Response	In a phase I study of larotrectinib in 67 patients with solid tumours, 8 patients were recorded as having objective response. 7 of these harboured NTRK fusions, and one had a NTRK1 amplification. This patient's tumour had a size reduction measured as 45% and a response duration of 3.7 months. It is not stated in the publication whether a survey of amplification status in other patients in the study was done.
1212	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	C	Pertuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	A patient with cholangiocarcinoma harboring with ERBB2 amplification (3+) detected by circulating tumor DNA testing and confirmed by tissue-based testing was treated with trastuzumab and pertuzumab.

1316	NTRK1	LMNA::NTRK1 E11-E10	C	Entrectinib	Sensitivity/Response	After disease progression with no objective response to therapy, a 75-year-old with metastatic colorectal cancer that spread to the liver displayed elevated NTRK1 expression in both primary tumor and liver metastasis as measured by immunohistochemistry. FISH of the tumor and patient derived xenograft indicated NTRK1 involvement. 5’RACE PCR discovered a novel LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 11 & exon 10), which resulted in the expression of two different fusion splice transcripts (exons 1-10 with exons 10-16 and exons 1-11 with exons 10-16). Fusion expression of both transcripts was confirmed by western blot, and Sanger sequencing revealed the fusion to be in-frame with the kinase domain intact. After 4 weeks of treatment with Entrectinib, CT scan revealed the patient showed a partial response with a 30% reduction of target lesions. This response was maintained for 5 months.
847	ABL1	BCR::ABL F359V	C	Bosutinib	Resistance	This was a retrospective study of dasatinib and/or nilotinib-resistant or -intolerant patients pretreated with imatinib aimed at evaluating the efficacy of bosutanib monotherapy.

Of patients with F359V, 0/2 had a CHR and 1/2 had a MCyR. Nine patients in this study had multiple kinase domain mutations, but it was not indicated when mutations were co-occuring.
1239	DPYD	EXON 11-19 DELETION	C	Fluorouracil	Sensitivity/Response	A 69 year old patient diagnosed with HNSCC presented with an unresectable neck mass three months after surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy. A biopsy was taken for whole genome and transcriptome analysis and the patient was started on systemic therapy. After showing resistance to the systemic therapy treatment with 5-FU and leucovorin was initiated based on the discovery of a somatic exon 11-19 in frame deletion in DPYD, which was hypothesized to increase sensitivity to 5-FU in the tumour. A dramatic clinical and radiographic response was sustained for 17 weeks, but following a 3 week treatment break a new nodule appeared. This recurrence showed resistance to re-initiation of treatment with capecitabine (oral 5-FU), and analysis of an additional biopsy provided no evidence as to the mechanism of resistance.
704	ERBB2	OVEREXPRESSION	C	Lapatinib	Sensitivity/Response	Case report of a 60-year old patient with p16 positive tumor of the tonsil with lung metastases after primary radiochemotherapy. The metastases were analyzed using a commercial molecular analysis and overexpression of HER2 was identified (IHC, 95% of cells, with high intensity 3+ staining) which was confirmed on RNA-level. The patient was treated with single-agent lapatinib. A locally recurrent tumor was excised (and found HER2-negative) and the patient continued on lapatinib (for 2 years) as well as 5 cycles 5-FU and irinotecan. All lung metastases decreased in size within 3 months of lapatinib mono therapy initiation. The patient remains free of local or distant disease 5 years after starting lapatinib.
1294	ABL1	BCR::ABL E459K	C	Imatinib	Resistance	In this study, patients on imatinib monotherapy were monitored for ABL1 kinase domain variants in BCR-ABL1 fusions amplified from peripheral blood RNA.

Concurrently, the Y253F and E255V variants were found in ~50% and ~50% of BCR-ABL1 transcripts, respectively. Imatinib was withdrawn at 10 months and the patient died 14 months after treatment initiation.
1283	ABL1	BCR::ABL S438C	C	Dasatinib	Resistance	Prior to dasatinib treatment, one imatinib-resistant patient with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase had the BCR-ABL1 fusion with the S438C, K466E, and K466R secondary variants in 6/10, 1/10. and 1/10 bacterial clones generated using peripheral blood RNA. They had no best hematologic and no best cytogenetic responses to dasatinib which were poor compared to responses in patients with unmutated BCR-ABL1.
1284	ABL1	BCR::ABL Y253H	C	Dasatinib	Resistance	Prior to dasatinib treatment, one imatinib-resistant patient with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase had the BCR-ABL1 fusion with Y253H, M388L, and M388L/M244V variants in 4/10, 5/10, and 1/10 clones, respectively. Clones were generated using peripheral blood RNA.

1288	PDGFRB	OVEREXPRESSION	C	Sunitinib	Sensitivity/Response	A 37-year-old man presented with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). Post resection, multiple nodular metastases were found in both lungs and the disease progressed following treatments with cytotoxic agents and microwave ablation. Overexpression of PDGFRB was detected by IHC and a COL1A1-PDGFB fusion was detected by RT-PCR. Increased PDGFRB is activated by the COL1A1-PDGFB fusion product, which promotes the overactivation of downstream PDGFRB signaling pathways. Imatinib treatment failed as stable disease was followed by disease spread and progression. The patient was then treated with a daily oral dose of sunitinib (a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor) for 4 consecutive weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period. After 2 months on sunitinib, the patient experienced overall shrinkage of the body’s tumor mass (reduction of tumor in arm and partial response in lung and pancreas metastases). Sunitinib resulted in 9 months of progression free survival and improved quality of life. Ultimately, the disease progressed and the patient died 46 months after diagnosis.
1289	ABL1	BCR::ABL F359V	C	Dasatinib	Resistance	Prior to dasatinib treatment, one imatinib-resistant patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in myeloid blast crisis had the BCR-ABL1 fusion with F359V, F359V/Q252R, and L273M secondary variants in 9/12, 1/12, and 2/12 clones, respectively. Clones were generated using peripheral blood RNA. The patient had complete best cytogenetic and no evidence of leukemia best hematologic responses to dasatinib which were better outcomes in comparison to those seen in patients with unmutated BCR-ABL in this phase.
770	ABL1	BCR::ABL M351T	C	Imatinib	Resistance	In this study, patients on imatinib monotherapy were monitored for ABL1 kinase domain variants in BCR-ABL1 fusions amplified from peripheral blood RNA. Three CP patients, with the M351T variants detected prior to resistance, had hematologic responses prior to progression. One patient became resistant after the appearance of the M351T variant but responded to dose escalation. The last patient, who also had the Q252H variant, progressed to myeloid blast crisis (MBC) after which there was cytogenetic evidence of a double Ph-chromosome and no detectable secondary variants. Three accelerated-phase (AP) patients returned to CP and had M351T variants. One of these patients also had E255K and F359V variants and progressed to AP. The remaining two, one of whom also had H396R variant, progressed to MBC and died. Two additional AP patients also had M351T variants but initially had CHRs.

887	ABL1	BCR::ABL T315I	C	Axitinib	Sensitivity/Response	In this study, enzymatic profiling, crystal structures, and proliferation assays using Ba/F3 with the BCR-ABL1 variant showed higher sensitivity to axitinib in fusions with the T315I variant of ABL1 compared to wildtype ABL1 (IC50 of 21nM vs. 217 nM in resazurin assay; IC50 of 98 nM vs. 823 nM in tritiated thymidine assay). Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM MNCs) were isolated from a chronic myeloid leukemia patients with the BCR-ABL1 T315I variant who was pretreated with imatinib, dasatinib, and chemotherapy. This patient's cells were sensitive to Ponatinib and Axitinib and insensitive to Nilotinib, Imatinib, and Dasatinib according to drug sensitivity scoring in proliferation assays. The patient was given axitinib monotherapy resulting in a significant decrease in T315I transcript levels in bone marrow (P<0.05). The authors note this as an example of a drug specifically targeting the secondary mutant resistant form of a protein.

Of patients with F486S, 0/1 had a CHR and 0/1 had a MCyR. Nine patients in this study had multiple kinase domain mutations, but it was not indicated when mutations were co-occuring.
907	ABL1	BCR::ABL L364I	C	Dasatinib	Resistance	Prior to dasatinib treatment, one imatinib-resistant patient with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase had the BCR-ABL1 fusion with the L364I secondary variant in 9/12 bacterial clones generated using peripheral blood RNA. They had complete best hematologic and no cytogenetic responses to dasatinib which were comparable to responses in patients with unmutated BCR-ABL1.
1048	ERBB2	OVEREXPRESSION	C	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	Case report of a a 58 year old man with multiple bone metastases after local therapy of a carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma one year earlier. The original tumor tested strongly positive for HER2/neu by immunohistochemistry. The patient was treated with trastuzumab, capecitabine, and zoledronic acid. He experienced total resolution of symptoms and repeat FDG-PET scan after three cycles revealed interval disease resolution. Continued treatment resulted in maintenance of disease control for over 2 years.
904	ABL1	BCR::ABL H396R	C	Bosutinib	Resistance	In this retrospective study, imatinib-resistant or -intolerant patients, with chronic phase CML and BCR-ABL fusions, were treated with bosutanib monotherapy. Complete hematologic response (CHR) and major cytogenetic response (MCyR) were comparable for patients with Abl1 mutation versus without. The authors conclude that bosutanib is effective across all BCR-ABL mutations observed except T315I. Of patients with H396R evaluated, 1/1 had a complete hematologic response.
903	ABL1	BCR::ABL H396R	C	Bosutinib	Resistance	This was a retrospective study of dasatinib and/or nilotinib-resistant or -intolerant patients pretreated with imatinib aimed at evaluating the efficacy of bosutanib monotherapy. All patients had chronic phase CML and BCR-ABL fusions. Complete hematologic response (CHR) and major cytogenetic response (MCyR) were comparable for patients with Abl1 mutation versus without. Of patients with H396R, 0/1 had a CHR and 0/1 had a MCyR. Nine patients in this study had multiple kinase domain mutations, but it was not indicated when mutations were co-occuring.
902	ABL1	BCR::ABL L387M	C	Dasatinib	Resistance	Prior to dasatinib treatment, one imatinib-resistant patient with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase had the BCR-ABL1 fusion with L387M, L387M/F192L, and E450G variants in 7/10, 2/10, and 1/10 clones, respectively. Clones were generated using peripheral blood RNA. The patient had minimal best cytogenetic and complete best hematologic responses to dasatinib which were comparable to responses in patients with unmutated BCR-ABL1.
901	ABL1	BCR::ABL L387M	C	Dasatinib	Resistance	This is a retrospective study of imatinib-resistant (n = 805) or -intolerant (n = 238), chronic myeloid leukemia (chronic-phase), patients with mutations in the BCR-ABL gene fusion kinase domain from the START-C, START-R, and CA180-034 trials. With dasatinib monotherapy, patients with and without ABL1 mutation had comparable complete hematologic response (CHR), major cytogenetic response (MCyR), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), and major molecular response (MMR). Out of 5 patients with L387M mutations, 4, 4, and 5 achieved CCyR, MCyR, and CHR with dasatinib monotherapy, respectively. Analyses by variant included patients with multiple kinase domain mutations.
900	ABL1	BCR::ABL E355G	C	Dasatinib	Resistance	Prior to dasatinib treatment, three imatinib-resistant patients with chronic myeloid leukemia had the BCR-ABL1 fusion with the E355G secondary variant in one or more bacterial clones. Clones were generated using peripheral blood RNA. The first two, in chronic and accelerated phases, had minimal or no best cytogenetic responses but had complete or no evidence of leukemia best hematologic responses, respectively. Of these, the first had E355G and E355G/Q252R variants in 8/10 and 1/10 clones, respectively, and the second had E355G, E355G/L324Q, and L324Q variants in 6/10, 1/10, and 3/10 clones, respectively. The third patient, in lymphoid blast crisis with the E355G variant in 10/10 clones, had complete best hematologic and partial best cytogenetic responses to dasatinib. All responses were comparable to responses in patients with unmutated BCR-ABL1.
1182	ABL1	BCR::ABL F359V	C	Imatinib Mesylate	Resistance	In a phase II study of 60 imatinib-resistant patients with BCR-ABL mutations, 7 had F359V mutations
898	ABL1	BCR::ABL E355G	C	Dasatinib	Resistance	In this phase II multinational study, patients with accelerated phase CML and BCR-ABL fusions were treated with dasatinib monotherapy. Response rate among 60 imatinib-resistant patients with BCR-ABL mutations did not differ from the rate of the total population of 100 imatinib-resistant or -intolerant patients. 44 (73%) of 60 BCR-ABL mutant patients achieved major hematologic responses (MaHRs) and 18 (30%) of 60 achieved major cytogenetic responses (MCyRs). Of patients with E355G, 2/4 had MaHRs and 2/4 had MCyRs which were comparable to response rates among wild type.
897	ABL1	BCR::ABL E355G	C	Bosutinib	Resistance	In this retrospective study, imatinib-resistant or -intolerant patients, with chronic phase CML and BCR-ABL fusions, were treated with bosutanib monotherapy. Complete hematologic response (CHR) and major cytogenetic response (MCyR) were comparable for patients with Abl1 mutation versus without. The authors conclude that bosutanib is effective across all BCR-ABL mutations observed except T315I. Of patients with E355G evaluated, 2/2 had complete hematologic responses and 1/2 had major cytogenetic responses.
896	ABL1	BCR::ABL M351T	C	Dasatinib	Resistance	Prior to dasatinib treatment, four imatinib-resistant patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase had the BCR-ABL1 fusion with the M351T and M351S; M351T; M351T; and M351T secondary variants in 8/9 and 1/9; 4/10; 10/10; and 11/11 bacterial clones, respectively. Clones were generated using peripheral blood RNA. They had complete response as best hematologic response and complete (n = 3) or partial (n = 1) responses as best cytogenetic response to dasatinib. An additional patient, in myeloid blast crisis, had the M351T variant in 10/10 clones with complete response as best hematologic response and complete response as best cytogenetic response to dasatinib. An additional patient in accelerated phase had the M351T and M351A variants in 6/10 and 1/10 clones, respectively, with complete response as best hematologic response and none as best cytogenetic response to dasatinib. Overall, responses among these patients were comparable to those among patients with unmutated BCR-ABL1.
914	ABL1	BCR::ABL E255V	C	Dasatinib	Resistance	Three chronic myeloid leukemia patients had the BCR-ABL1 fusion with the E255V secondary variant in one or more bacterial clones generated using peripheral blood RNA. They had no best cytogenetic responses but had complete (n = 2) or minor best hematologic responses to dasatinib which were comparable to responses in patients with unmutated BCR-ABL1. The first patient, in chronic phase, had E255V, E255V/Q447R, E255V/T345A, and E255V/T345A/H396R variants in 6/10, 2/10, 1/10, and 1/10 clones, respectively. The second patient, in chronic phase, had E255V and E255K variants in 10/11 and 1/11 clones, respectively. The third patient, in myeloid blast crisis, had E255V and E292V variants in 10/12 and 2/12 clones, respectively.
1181	ABL1	BCR::ABL M244V	C	Imatinib Mesylate	Resistance	In a phase II study of 60 imatinib-resistant patients with BCR-ABL mutations, 5 had M244V mutations
0	BRAF	V600E AND V600M	C	Dabrafenib	Sensitivity/Response	A single 66-year old male patient with advanced melanoma thought to have concomitant BRAF V600E and V600M mutations responded rapidly to dabrafenib. His shoulder lesion reduced by 60% after 1 week of therapy and was gone after 1 month.
669	NTRK3	ETV6::NTRK3 G623R	C	Entrectinib	Resistance	Case report of a patient with mammary analogue secretory carcinoma (MASC) harboring an etv6-ntrk3 fusion. The patient was treated with entrectinib and exhibited a partial response for 7 months followed by disease progression. A NTRK3 exon 16 G623R (c.1867G>A) mutation was identified in the progressive tumor. Cell line and structural models revealed that this mutation conferred relative resistance to entrectinib.
418	ROS1	REARRANGEMENT	C	Ceritinib	Sensitivity/Response	"Case report of a 77-year old male patient with lung adenocarcinoma (T2aN1M0, stage IIA) without EGFR, KRAS, or BRAF mutations, and no ALK gene rearrangement. CD72-ROS1 was identified in sequencing after progression on chemotherapy. Crizotinib at 250 mg orally twice daily led to resolution of metastatic disease. The patient remained disease-free for 13 months when a CT-scan showed a relapse with two nodules in the right lower lobe. Stereotactic radiation therapy, gamma knife radiosurgery, and ipilimumab did not lead to a relevant response (new pleural nodules, new intracranial metastases). The patient next received ceritinib on a “Signature Trial"" for tumors with aberrations in ALK or ROS1 that are treated with oral ceritinib (LDK378) at 750 mg daily (NCT02186821). Restaging scans after two cycles showed a partial response confirmed after four cycles (56% decrease) per RECIST1.1. MRI showed that his brain metastases decreased as well."
106	ALK	EML4::ALK L1152R	C	Crizotinib	Resistance	Case-report of a patient with an acquired ALK L1152R mutation and resistance to crizotinib treatment. A cell line model also showed resistance against ALK inhibition.
416	ALK	EML4::ALK E20-E20	C	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	This case study presented a 53-year-old never-smoker with a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm. Morphology and immunohistochemistry were unable to establish the primary tumor site. Right upper extremity (RUE), scalp, and multiple lung lesions were apparent. A lung lesion sample with sufficient material for molecular profiling was not attainable but sufficient material was present from the RUE for hybrid capture genomic profiling  (FoundationOne kit was used). EML4-ALK variant 2 was found, and the patient was started on crizotinib. Rapid symptom improvement was seen. After 1 month, a CT scan showed significant size reduction in lung tumors, and after 5 months the patient was asymptomatic with an entirely negative examination.
627	MET	AMPLIFICATION	C	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	In an evaluation of a patient with crizotinib-sensitive lung adenocarcinoma, an MET-Amplification was identified using CGP.  The patient attained a reduction in the target lesions by 38.7%, and the patient maintained response for at least 5 months post-treatment.
414	ALK	FUSION	C	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	Crizotinib at 250mg daily was given to two patients with relapsed ALK-rearranged anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Patient one, 26 yrs old, had been treated with the CHOP-15 chemotherapy regimen, then salvage chemotherapy to prepare for autologous bone marrow transplant but ultimately relapsed. After initiation of crizotinib, PET, CT and bone marrow aspirates showed complete remission of previous lesions at 28 days. At time of publication the patient continued to show persistent response at 6 months. A 20 year old patient relapsed after one month of CHOP, and was treated with further chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation resulting in partial response of 1 month. Crizotinib was initialized, and after 12 days PET scan showed complete regression of all lesions. On day 60 bone marrow aspirates were ALK-negative (pretreatment evaluation showed 8% ALK-positive). The authors conclude these two cases indicate sensitivity to crizotinib of relapsed ALK-rearranged ALCL.
107	ALK	EML4::ALK G1269A	C	Crizotinib	Resistance	This study analyzed patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were positive for EML4-ALK fusions (ALK+) and progressed on crizotinib monotherapy. One ALK+ patient harbored the common E6;A20 fusion with ALK G1269A co-mutation in post-crizotinib progression biopsies. The presence of ALK G1269A pre-crizotinib could not be evaluated. This patient was a 21 year old non-smoking male with adenocarcinoma, wt for KRAS and EGFR, negative for ALK copy number gain, who experienced crizotinib as a 2nd line therapy. The patient's best response on crizotinib was stable disease (377 days on treatment). In vitro, Ba/F3 cell line expressing EML4-ALK fusion (E6a;A20, a known sensitizing alteration) and ALK G1269A co-mutation demonstrated resistance to crizotinib treatment (341 nmol/L vs. 22 nmol/L) compared to Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK fusion. Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability and colony formation. Levels of phosphorylation of ALK, ERK, STAT3, and AKT were higher in ALK+ G1269A mutant cells than ALK+ controls, by western blot. The authors note that ALK G1269A likely induces resistance by preventing crizotinib from accessing its binding pocket in the ALK kinase domain.
628	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	C	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	A 71-year old male with metastatic extramammary Paget’s disease of the scrotum overexpressing Her2/neu was treated with trastuzumab, achieving a complete response. At 12 months, he maintains stable disease.
108	ALK	EML4::ALK G1269A	C	Crizotinib	Resistance	2 out of 7 patients with an acquired resistance to crizotinib had a G1269A mutation. One of these patients also harbored a L1196M mutation. In vitro follow-up showed reduced crizotinib-induced ALK dephosphorylation (293T) and apoptosis (Ba/F3) when EML4-ALK G1269A overexpression was compared to EML4-ALK overexpression in these cell lines.
109	ALK	EML4::ALK AND AMPLIFICATION	C	Crizotinib	Resistance	This study analyzed patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were positive for EML4-ALK fusions (ALK+) and progressed on crizotinib monotherapy. One out of 11 patients with acquired crizotinib resistance showed >4-fold increase in rearranged ALK copy number between pre- and post- crizotinib biopsies as measured by FISH. This patient's tumor did not harbor ALK point mutations, and was wt for KRAS and EGFR. This patient was a 51 year old non-smoking male with adenocarcinoma, whose best response was partial response (454 days on crizotinib, 2 prior lines of therapy). The authors suggest that ALK copy number gain alone may induce crizotinib resistance.
217	MET	AMPLIFICATION	C	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	Case report of a 73 year old patient with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung that tested negative for EGFR, KRAS and PIK3CA mutations and ALK and ROS1 rearrangements. c-MET amplification was detected by FISH. Crizotinib led to a partial response.
409	ALK	FUSION	C	Retaspimycin Hydrochloride	Sensitivity/Response	In this study, heavily pretreated advanced NSCLC patients with various molecular tumor makeup were treated with Hsp90 inhibitor IPI-504 to assess overall response rate. The study did not reach the targeted endpoint of 20% ORR. However, of 3/12 patients found to be ALK-rearranged via break apart FISH assay, 2 showed a partial response and the third stable disease, which was durable for 7.2 months. The authors note that the break apart FISH assay used to determine ALK-rearrangement status does not determine the identity of the ALK fusion partner and the promising results shown here may be dependent on the nature of the ALK fusion partner.
112	EGFR	VIII	C	Afatinib	Sensitivity/Response	Case report of a 58-year old patient with disease progression after radiotherapy and three temozolomide cycles. Afatinib and temozolomide led to disease regression. At last assessment 63 treatment cycles had been completed and the patient had survived for about 5 years since recurrence. Identified EGFR aberrations included EGFRvIII positivity, EGFR gene amplification and three somatic EGFR mutations.
475	ALK	ALK FUSION F1245C	C	Ceritinib	Sensitivity/Response	A 52 year old male never smoker was diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC adenocarcinoma and was treated with chemotherapy with eventual disease progression. He tested positive for ALK rearrangement via break apart FISH assay, and started crizotinib with near complete response for 27 months. Progression then occurred and biopsy of a pleural nodule was performed with hybrid-capture NGS. EML4-ALK variant 3 with F1245C mutation was found with allele frequency of 2% and tumor purity 13%. Due to slow progression and low tumor burden crizotinib was maintained for additional 8 months, and then he was transitioned onto ceritinib at 750 mg daily. After 3 months ceritinib, complete radiographic response was seen and the patient was without evidence of disease at 6 months. Dose was reduced to 600 mg ceritinib daily due to gastrointestinal side effects.
476	ALK	ALK FUSION F1245C	C	Crizotinib	Resistance	A 52 year old with a non-smoking history was diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC-adenocarcinoma and treated with chemotherapy.  Upon disease progression, the initial diagnostic biopsy tested positive for ALK-rearrangement using break apart FISH, but the ALK fusion was not sequenced for mutations. Break-apart signal was positive in 66% of tumor cells. Crizotinib was initiated and a sustained near complete response for 27 months was observed, after which an FDG-avid cervical lymph node appeared along with pleural effusions and pleural nodules. A pleural nodule was biopsied and profiled using hybrid-capture next generation sequencing, and revealed EML4-ALK variant 3 with F1245C mutation at mutant allele frequency of 2% and tumor purity of 13%. Crizotinib was maintained for 8 additional months due to low tumor burden and slow progression.
555	RET	OVEREXPRESSION	C	Sunitinib	Sensitivity/Response	A 78-year-old man presented with oral papillary adenocarcinoma and lung metastases that were refractory to standard treatment.  Tumor sequencing showed increased MAPK activity due to RET over-expression and PTEN deletion, therefore sunitinib (RET inhibitor) was initiated.  After 28 days post-administration, the lung metastases decreased in size by 22% (28mm to 21mm) and no new metastatic lesions had appeared.  After 4 months, the patient grew resistant to treatment.
266	PTEN	LOSS	C	Akt Inhibitor MK2206	Sensitivity/Response	Among 33 patients treated with pan-AKT inhibitor MK-2206 in this phase 1 study, one patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and PTEN loss/KRAS G12D mutation experienced a decrease of approximately 60% in cancer antigen 19-9 levels and 23% shrinkage in tumor measurements.
396	ALK	EML4::ALK E20-E20	C	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	In the PROFILE 1001 study, from 31 NSCLC tumors positive for ALK fusions with sufficient material for RT-PCR aided exon breakpoint identification, 1 case of EML4-ALK variant 2 (EML4 exon 20 fused to ALK exon 20) was found. This patient had adenocarcinoma and a 9 pack year smoking history. Crizotinib treatment duration was over 16 weeks. The patient had multiple lines of prior treatment and showed a partial response to first-time crizotinib treatment. Overall, in the 82 ALK positive patients treated in the study, 46 had partial responses (including this patient) and 1 had a complete response for an overall response rate of 57%.
537	ALK	EML4::ALK I1171S	C	Crizotinib	Resistance	Case study describes a caucasian male (age 38) never smoker presenting with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer with an ALK rearrangement. Patient was given crizotinib and exhibited a partial response after 5 months with brain metastasis occurring at 21 months. Patient then received alectinib and exhibited partial response however liver metastasis presented after 12 months on alectinib. Sequencing of this liver metastasis revealed an EML4-ALK fusion with an I1171S variant at a variant frequency of 36% (tumor purity estimated as 70%).
636	MET	AMPLIFICATION	C	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	Case report of two patients with MET amplification (MET:CEP7 ratio ≥5) and no concomitant MET exon 14 deletion. A response to crizotinib was observed in both cases suggesting that MET amplification may predict response to this drug even in the absence of MET exon 14 mutations.
536	ALK	EML4::ALK I1171S	C	Alectinib	Resistance	Case study describes a caucasian male (age 38) never smoker presenting with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer with an ALK rearrangement. Patient was given crizotinib and exhibited a partial response after 5 months with brain metastasis occurring at 21 months. Patient then received alectinib and exhibited partial response however liver metastasis presented after 12 months on alectinib. Sequencing of this liver metastasis revealed an EML4-ALK fusion with an I1171S variant at a variant frequency of 36% (tumor purity estimated as 70%).
110	ALK	EML4::ALK AND AMPLIFICATION	C	Crizotinib	Resistance	One patient with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer and an acquired resistance to crizotinib showed new ALK amplification (4.1 fold increase compared to pre-crizotinib specimen as measured by FISH) and harbored an EGFR L858R mutation.
626	ALK	FUSION	C	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	In an evaluation of a patient with crizotinib-sensitive lung adenocarcinoma, an EML4-ALK-E13;A20 rearrangement was identified using CGP.  The patient attained a reduction in the target lesions by 14.2%, however, the patient relapsed 17 months later.
625	ROS1	REARRANGEMENT	C	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	In an evaluation of a patient and never smoker with crizotinib-sensitive lung adenocarcinoma, an SDC4-ROS1 rearrangement was identified using comprehensive genomic profiling. The patient attained a decrease in RESIST target lesions by 26.8% (stable disease); however, the patient relapsed 4 months later. This patient also harbored a TP53 mutation, MCL1 amplification and CDKN2A deletion.
560	FLT3	OVEREXPRESSION	C	Sunitinib	Sensitivity/Response	A 25-year-old Caucasian male presented with a second relapse of B-ALL. RNA sequencing revealed FLT3 overexpression (also confirmed by IHC). The patient was treated with 22 days of sunitinib, permitting the patient to undergo a bone marrow transplant. A bone marrow biopsy showed complete clearance by variant allele frequency and the patient remains in remission 4-years post matched-unrelated donor allograft.
459	PALB2	BIALLELIC INACTIVATION	C	Mitomycin	Sensitivity/Response	In a patient with gemcitabine-refractory pancreatic cancer, a tumor-derived xenograft was found to be responsive to Mitomycin C. After disease progression, the patient was started on a regimen of mitomycin C, and the patient was shown to be asymptomatic after 3 years of follow-up.
447	ALK	ALK FUSION I1171	C	Ceritinib	Sensitivity/Response	The MGH056-1 cell line was derived from an NSCLC patient with ALK-rearrangement who had progressed on crizotinib and then on alectinib. the cell line was also resistant to crizotinib and alectinib, and sequencing of ALK from the cell line revealed the I1171T mutation. Further testing of this mutation in BaF3 cells revealed that cells expressing EML4-ALk with I1171T mutation required 10x higher concentration to induce cell death than BaF3 cells with wild-type EML4-ALK. In contrast, ceritinib caused loss of viability in EML4-ALK wild-type and I1171T BaF3 cells at comparable concentrations. Ceritinib was also effective at killing MGH056-1 cells that were resistant to alectinib, and reduced Akt and ERK phosphorylation in these cells. Finally, administration of ceritinib to the crizotinib and alectinib resistant patient let to tumor regression and partial response lasting 7 months.
446	ALK	ALK FUSION I1171	C	Alectinib	Resistance	The I1171T mutation in ALK fusions was found in a NSCLC patient shown positive for ALK rearrangement via break apart FISH assay, who progressed after 8 months of crizotinib, and then progressed again after 4 months of alectinib. The MGH056-1 cell line was derived from this patient, and this cell line was resistant to alectinib. Sequencing of MGH056-1 cells revealed the I1171T mutation in ALK. In cell culture studies Ba/F3 cells with EML4-ALK I1171T required more that 10x the concentration of alectinib to significantly reduce viability that was required for EML4-ALK wild-type expressing cells. Computer simulation studies indicated that the I1171T mutation interfered with alectinib binding at the ALK active site.
441	ALK	FUSION	C	Alectinib	Sensitivity/Response	In this case study of a critically ill 29 year old male nonsmoker with advanced metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC, alectinib (CH5424802), was administered as first line treatment. Where most clinical trials only admit patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, this patient had PS 4 due to respiratory failure, multiple bone metastases and complications from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Administration of alectinib at 300 mg twice daily was followed by marked improvement seen in tests associated with DIC, pulmonary metastasis and change in PS from 4 to 0. Further improvements after a couple of months suggested a rapid complete response. Alectinib was well tolerated in this first line treatment of a critically ill ALK-positive NSCLC patient.
437	ALK	FUSION	C	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	A 27 year old female patient with advanced-stage IV, CD20 negative diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). ALK rearrangement was determined by FISH, but the ALK fusion partner was not determined due to limited tissue. The patient underwent treatment with CHOP chemotherapy regimen and radiation but did not respond. The patient progressed following salvage chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant. Crizotinib was then administered at 250 mg twice daily, and LDH levels rapidly dropped along with disappearance of palpable lymphadenopathy, but progression ensued after 21 days and the patient died soon after. The authors attribute the short response to crizotinib to the possibility of this tumor having an ALK fusion variant less responsive to ALK inhibition and to a high Ki-67 index in the patient, and deem that despite the brief response, crizotinib shows promise in ALK rearranged DLBCL.
580	MET	AMPLIFICATION	C	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	Case report of a patient with BRAF V600E mutant metastatic colorectal cancer. Combined EGFR and BRAF inhibition (panitumumab and vemurafenib) showed an initial partial response for 4 months. Re-biopsy at the time of progression showed a MET amplification and overexpression (IHC, ISH) but no secondary mutations in candidate resistance genes (EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, MAP2K1). MET amplification was also present in a subset of tumor cells in the pretreatment sample. MET amplification was also identified in 3/17 (18%) chemonaive BRAF V600E colorectal cancer tumor tissues. Overexpression of MET in a BRAF mutant CRC cell line (WiDr) confered resistance to combined vemurafenib and panitumumab. The addition of crizotinib to this combination restored sensitivity in vitro. The patient was started on combined vemurafenib and crizotinib in January 2016 and had a metabolic, clinical and tumor marker response that was ongoing at the time of publication (06/16) without significant toxicity.
579	MET	AMPLIFICATION	C	Vemurafenib	Sensitivity/Response	Case report of a patient with BRAF V600E mutant metastatic colorectal cancer. Combined EGFR and BRAF inhibition (panitumumab and vemurafenib) showed an initial partial response for 4 months. Re-biopsy at the time of progression showed a MET amplification and overexpression (IHC, ISH) but no secondary mutations in candidate resistance genes (EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, MAP2K1). MET amplification was also present in a subset of tumor cells in the pretreatment sample. MET amplification was also identified in 3/17 (18%) chemonaive BRAF V600E colorectal cancer tumor tissues. Overexpression of MET in a BRAF mutant CRC cell line (WiDr) confered resistance to combined vemurafenib and panitumumab. The addition of crizotinib to this combination restored sensitivity in vitro. The patient was started on combined vemurafenib and crizotinib in January 2016 and had a metabolic, clinical and tumor marker response that was ongoing at the time of publication (06/16) without significant toxicity.
598	AKT2	AMPLIFICATION	C	Everolimus	Sensitivity/Response	Case report of a 74-year old woman with EGFR- and ALK-negative lung adenocarcinoma. FISH identified a deletion of 5'RET (FISH, indicating RET-gene rearrangement) and genomic testing confirmed a fusion of KIF5B and RET, as well as an AKT2 gene amplification. The patient was enrolled in a clinical trial with vandetanib and everolimus (NCT01582191) with everolimus used to enhance brain accumulation of vandetanib. After two cycles of therapy a repeat MRI brain showed a decrease in the intracranial disease burden and PET/CT showed systemic response as well.

600	PTEN	EXPRESSION	C	Fulvestrant	Resistance	Case report of a 44-year-old patient with recurrent HER2-positive breast cancer. The primary tumor was HR positive; however, the metastatic tumor was HR negative. The patient was resistant to classical chemotherapeutic agents and anti-HER2 treatment. Thus, the combination of everolimus and fulvestrant was administered. The patient experienced stable disease and PFS of 10 months. Genetic testing of pleural effusion after disease progression revealed a PIK3CA H1047R gene mutation but was positive for PTEN expression (IHC).

605	JUN	OVEREXPRESSION	C	Irbesartan	Sensitivity/Response	A 67-year-old female presents with recurrent metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma.  Immunohistochemical and genetic workup showed overexpression of c-JUN and FOS, which presumably signals through the RAAS pathway. The patient was treated with irbesartan and after 5 weeks of therapy, the CEA value decreased from 18 to 3.1 and there was radiological resolution of the disease.  Her 10 month CEA was 1.4.
69	MET	AMPLIFICATION	C	Onartuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	A case-study describing a patient with MET polysomy, MET over-expression and evidence of autocrine HGF-production (the growth factor ligand of MET). The patient initially achieved a complete response on MET-Inhibitor MetMAb (Onartuzumab) for 2 years and mixed response after recurrence with resistance in some of the newly developing metastases.

606	FOS	OVEREXPRESSION	C	Irbesartan	Sensitivity/Response	A 67-year-old female presents with recurrent metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma.  Immunohistochemical and genetic workup showed overexpression of c-JUN and FOS, which presumably signals through the RAAS pathway. The patient was treated with Irbesartan and after 5 weeks of therapy, the CEA value decreased from 18 to 3.1 and there was radiological resolution of the disease.  Her 10 month CEA was 1.4.
565	FLT3	ITD	C	Sorafenib	Sensitivity/Response	Six children with relapsed or refractory FLT3-ITD-positive AML received initial therapy with sorafenib (alone or in combination with clofarabine and cytarabine).  Four of the patients initially achieved morphological complete remission (bone marrow blasts <5%), however, 3 patients developed resistance within 14-37 weeks and and 1 required a bone marrow transplant.  Two patients did not have any clinical response to sorafenib upon initial treatment.
428	ROS1	CD74::ROS1 G2032R	C	Crizotinib	Resistance	ROS1 kinase domain mutations were assessed in two patients with stage IIIa/IV pulmonary adenocarcinoma and a cell line. The ROS1 G2032R mutation was identified in a crizotinib-resistant tumor from one of the patients harboring the CD74–ROS1 fusion. Expression of CD74–ROS1 G2032R in Ba/F3 cells conferred resistance to crizotinib combared to CD74–ROS1 (IC50=353.62+/-20.15 vs. 2.76+/-0.82).
102	PIK3CA	AMPLIFICATION	C	Pictilisib	Sensitivity/Response	One platinum-refractory epithelial ovarian cancer patient with PTEN loss and PIK3CA amplification had a partial response on treatment with PI3K inhibitor pictilisib (GDC-0941) in this phase 1 study. A total of 60 patients with advanced solid tumors were enrolled in this study.
38	ALK	EML4::ALK T1151INST	C	Crizotinib	Resistance	A lung adenocarcinoma patient responded to crizotinib treatment for 12 months, after which the cancer relapsed and sequencing of the ALK tyrosine kinase domain revealed a 1151insT mutation. This mutation was not found in the pre-crizotinib biopsy. EML4-ALK T1151insT was expressed In Ba/F3 cells and an IC50 of 431.8 nM was obtained, which was 16 times higher than for EML4-ALK wild-type, indicating strong crizotinib resistance. EML4-ALK containing H3122 NSCLC cells were incubated in increasing levels of crizotinib inducing resistance. The resulting cell line H3122 CR2 had IC50 10x greater to crizotinib than parental H3122, and was found to contain 1151 insT mutation. In western blots, pALK levels in H3122 CR2 cells remained apparent under 1000 nM crizotinib, whereas pALK signal was ablated under these conditions in parental H3122 cells.
535	ALK	HIP1::ALK I1171N	C	Crizotinib	Resistance	Case study describes a female (age 58) never-smoker presenting with stage IV NSCLC with an ALK rearrangement (confirmed by fish). Patient was treated with crizotinib (partial response) and alectinib (complete response). Liver metastasis was noted after 12 months with sequencing revealing a HIP1-ALK fusion with a I1171N variant.
400	ALK	EML4::ALK E6-E20	C	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	In a set of 31 patients with NSCLC, RT-PCR was performed to test for known EML4-ALK variants.  Five patients tested positive for the 3a/3b EML4-ALK variant.  Of these, 4 had partial response (PR), and one had disease progression (DP), and this was the only DP in the group of 31.  In contrast, of the 13 testing positive for EML4-ALK variant 1, 12 showed PR, and 1 showed stable disease.  These results potentially mirror findings in the H2228 3a/3b containing NSCLC cell line where some literature indicates it does respond as strongly to ALK inhibition as other EML4-ALK NSCLC cell lines.
534	ALK	HIP1::ALK I1171N	C	Alectinib	Resistance	Case study describes a female (age 58) never-smoker presenting with stage IV NSCLC with an ALK rearrangement (confirmed by fish). Patient was treated with crizotinib (partial response) and alectinib (complete response). Liver metastasis was noted after 12 months with sequencing revealing a HIP1-ALK fusion with a I1171N variant.
25	KIT	INTERNAL DUPLICATION	C	Imatinib	Sensitivity/Response	In a case study, a patient with anal melanoma harboring a 7 codon duplication in the juxtamambrane region (exon 11) of KIT showed marked response 4 months after imatinib treatment.
168	ALK	EML4::ALK C1156Y	C	Ceritinib	Resistance	In this case report, a patient with metastatic, ALK-rearranged NSCLC with C1156Y mutation had tumor progression under sequential treatment with first crizotinib, then ceritinib and finally AUY922. Subsequent chemotherapy (carboplatin–pemetrexed) was administered and the patient had a response for 6 months before progression. Exome sequencing revealed the C1156Y mutation was present in <7% of the pretreatment tumor and in ~50% of the crizotinib tumor prior to ceritinib therapy.
651	CDKN2A	LOSS	C	Letrozole	Sensitivity/Response	A patient with metastatic ER-positive, her2-negative breast cancer with CDKN2A loss experienced a short-lived (~3-month) clinical response to palbociclib when given in combination with letrozole.
652	CDKN2A	LOSS	C	Palbociclib	Sensitivity/Response	A patient with metastatic ER-positive, her2-negative breast cancer with CDKN2A loss experienced a short-lived (~3-month) clinical response to palbociclib when given in combination with letrozole.
512	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	C	Erlotinib	Resistance	155 patients with lung adenocarcinomas underwent rebiopsy and genotyping (EGFR, AKT1, BRAF, ERBB2, KRAS, MEK1, NRAS, PIK3CA and FISH for MET and HER2) after the development of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors (gefitinib or erlotinib). 2 of 24 patients tested were found to have HER2 amplification (but no baseline samples available for analysis). One patient of which had a metastasis sample which was reported to have only HER2 amplification whereas another autopsy specimen from the same patient was HER2 negative but EGFR T790M positive.
511	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	C	Gefitinib	Resistance	155 patients with lung adenocarcinomas underwent rebiopsy and genotyping (EGFR, AKT1, BRAF, ERBB2, KRAS, MEK1, NRAS, PIK3CA and FISH for MET and HER2) after the development of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors (gefitinib or erlotinib). 2 of 24 patients tested were found to have HER2 amplification (but no baseline samples available for analysis). One patient of which had a metastasis sample which was reported to have only HER2 amplification whereas another autopsy specimen from the same patient was HER2 negative but EGFR T790M positive.
671	MSH2	LOSS	C	Durvalumab	Sensitivity/Response	Case report of a 45-year old woman of Japanese descent with recurrent urothelial carcinoma. The patient was identified to harbor mutations in MSH2 (A913fs*2, E226*, E580*) and in MSH6 (R361H) by panel sequencing as well as loss of expression of these genes as confirmed by IHC. Testing also revealed a high mutational load as well as 2+ PD-L1 expression in 80% of the cells.  The patient was treated with anti-PD-L1 inhibitor MEDI4736 and MEDI0680 in a phase 1 trial and had a complete remission within 2 months of treatment that was ongoing after 11 months.
670	MSH2	LOSS	C	Anti-PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody MEDI0680	Sensitivity/Response	Case report of a 45-year old woman of Japanese descent with recurrent urothelial carcinoma. The patient was identified to harbor mutations in MSH2 (A913fs*2, E226*, E580*) and in MSH6 (R361H) by panel sequencing as well as loss of expression of these genes as confirmed by IHC. Testing also revealed a high mutational load as well as 2+ PD-L1 expression in 80% of the cells.  The patient was treated with anti-PD-L1 inhibitor MEDI4736 and MEDI0680 in a phase 1 trial and had a complete remission within 2 months of treatment that was ongoing after 11 months.
284	ERBB2	KINASE DOMAIN MUTATION	C	Afatinib	Sensitivity/Response	A Phase II study for use of Afatinib in non- or light smokers with lung adenocarcinoma. Three patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinomas bearing mutations in the kinase domain of HER2 gene were identified (Y772_A775dup, G776L, and G778_P780dup). Objective response was observed in all three of these patients.
338	ROS1	CD74::ROS1 G2032R	C	Crizotinib	Resistance	Resistance to crizotinib developed in a patient with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma harboring a CD74-ROS1 rearrangement who had initially shown a dramatic response to treatment. An acquired G2032R mutation in the ROS1 kinase domain was observed in the resistant tumor, and was found to confer resistance to ROS1 kinase inhibition through steric interference with drug binding.
519	MTOR	E2014K AND E2419K	C	Pazopanib	Sensitivity/Response	"A phase 1 clinical trial identified a patient with chemotherapy-refractory urothelial carcinoma who had complete radiographic response lasting 14 months after combined everolimus and pazopanib treatment. This patient was exome sequenced and two mutations co-occurring in MTOR were identified. Expression of these mutations in HEK293T cells demonstrated these were activating mutations. The authors propose that these two activating mutations are the reason for the dramatic response to mTOR inhibition and considered them as ""biologically plausible"" to confer sensitivity to everolimus."
336	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	C	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	HER2 expression in uterine serous papillary carcinoma (USPC) is thought to be associated with poor prognosis and may act as a targetable driver mutation in this cancer.  HER2 overexpression in USPC is more common in African American women.  This report covered 2 African American patients, the first of which presented high-grade endometrial adenocarcinoma with IHC3+ HER2-positivity as well as positivity by FISH.  Prior treatment involved surgery and chemotherapy.  Treatment with pacitaxel/carboplatin with trastuzumab showed clear clinical improvement assessed by CT scan and drop in CA-125 levels from 988 to 7.9 U/mL.  The second patient had USPC, and was treated with surgery and radiation.  Trastuzumab monotheraby was then administered.  After 7 months of treatment, the patient showed no sign of disease progression and CA-125 had dropped from 144 to 41 U/mL.  The investigators conclude there is promise in trastuzumab-based therapies in advanced endometrial cancers, including USPC.
335	PML	PML::RARA L218P	C	Tretinoin	Resistance	The PML L218P mutation in the PML-RARa fusion was observed in a patient with previously ATRA-treated, relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia refractory to arsenic trioxide.
13	ALK	EML4::ALK C1156Y	C	Crizotinib	Resistance	A 28 year-old patient with T4N3M1 stage lung adenocarcinoma harboring an EML4-ALK variant 1 fusion was treated with crizotinib after failing conventional therapy. The patient achieved a partial response, but progressed after 5 months of treatment. Molecular analysis at relapse identified C1156Y in the ALK kinase domain of the fusion at an allele frequency of 41.8%. This variant was undetected by Sanger sequencing in the tumor collected before crizotinib treatment. Cytotoxicity assays revealed Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK C1156Y were more resistant to crizontinib than those expressing EML4-ALK wildtype. Immunoblot demonstrated crizontinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of the wildtype fusion, but not the EML4-ALK C1156Y fusion.
334	PML	PML::RARA A216V	C	Tretinoin	Resistance	The mutation A216V in the B2 domain of PML in the PML-RARa fusion was seen in a patient with ATRA-resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia.
14	ALK	EML4::ALK L1196M	C	Crizotinib	Resistance	A 28 year-old patient with non-small cell lung cancer was found to harbor the EML4-ALK (E13;A20) fusion using reverse transcription PCR. Treatment with 250mg crizotinib twice daily resulted in rapid improvement of symptoms and disease control for 5 months, followed by rapid disease progression. Analysis of pleural effusion samples obtained after relapse found L1196M at an allele frequency of 14%. This variant was undetected by Sanger sequencing in the tumor collected before crizotinib treatment. Cytotoxicity assays revealed Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK L1196M were more resistant to crizontinib than those expressing EML4-ALK wildtype. Immunoblot demonstrated crizontinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of the wildtype fusion, but not the EML4-ALK L1196M fusion.
510	MET	AMPLIFICATION	C	Erlotinib	Resistance	155 patients with lung adenocarcinomas underwent rebiopsy and genotyping (EGFR, AKT1, BRAF, ERBB2, KRAS, MEK1, NRAS, PIK3CA and FISH for MET and HER2) after the development of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors (gefitinib or erlotinib). MET amplification was seen in 4 of 75 patients tested (no baseline samples available). One patient had small cell transformation and MET amplification, two patients had EGFR T790M mutation and MET amplification.
328	ERBB2	P780INS	C	Dacomitinib	Sensitivity/Response	"In this phase II study (NCT00818441) of dacomitinib in HER2 amplified or mutant NSCLC tumors, three of 26 patients with HER2 p.P780_Y781insGSP or p.M774delinsWLV showed partial responses of duration between 3 and 14 months, while 13 patients with the more common HER2 p. A775_G776insYVMA showed no partial responses.  The authors conclude that in the set of activating HER2 mutations, benefits of an individual agent may be specific to certain mutations, and that ""HER2-positive lung cancers"" is not an adequate term to describe this group of distinguishable illnesses."
318	KIT	EXPRESSION	C	Imatinib	Sensitivity/Response	Case Report of a 42-year old patient with low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. IHC was focally positive for CD117. Imatinib mesylate led to complete metabolic response (PET-CT).
327	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	C	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	This report details 2 case studies in relapsed HER2 positive SCLC.  In the first case, a 50 pack-year patient showed intense non-mutant HER2 expression by IHC without DNA amplification, and had undergone multiple prior lines of treatment.  With induction of trastuzumab and irinotecan treatment, tumor regression was observed with progression free survival of 4.5 months.  Case 2 involved a 68 year old never-smoker with relapsed SCLC.  Tumor showed HER2 positive SCLC cells with no amplification or mutation.  Third line trastuzumab plus irinotecan brought about some symptom improvement and PFS of 3.5 months.  While the efficacy of trastuzumab against NSCLC with elevated levels of wild-type HER2 expression remains unclear, the authors conclude that trastuzumab based therapy is a promising strategy for chemo-resistant SCLC.
319	KIT	EXPRESSION	C	Imatinib	Sensitivity/Response	Case Report of a 41-year old patient with high-grade stromal endometrial sarcoma and a large abdominal and retroperitoneal mass progressing after chemotherapy. IHC for c-Kit was positive and treatment with imatinib led to an objective Response. Surgery was performed and the patient was free of disease two years later.
509	MET	AMPLIFICATION	C	Gefitinib	Resistance	155 patients with lung adenocarcinomas underwent rebiopsy and genotyping (EGFR, AKT1, BRAF, ERBB2, KRAS, MEK1, NRAS, PIK3CA and FISH for MET and HER2) after the development of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors (gefitinib or erlotinib). MET amplification was seen in 4 of 75 patients tested (no baseline samples available). One patient had small cell transformation and MET amplification, two patients had EGFR T790M mutation and MET amplification.
637	MET	AMPLIFICATION	C	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	Case report of a 59-year-old white female patient (60 pack-years) with a CUP-syndrome. Molecular profiling identified both MET amplification (16 copies) and a KRAS G12V mutation. The patient was treated with crizotinib and experienced a complete normalization of tumor metabolic activity for more than 19 months. Other identified aberrations include CCND1 amplification (8 copies), MYC amplification (9 copies) as well as KRAS G12V, TP53 R273L and CARD11 N184S.
326	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	C	Irinotecan	Sensitivity/Response	This report details 2 case studies in relapsed HER2 positive SCLC.  In the first case, a 50 pack-year patient showed intense non-mutant HER2 expression by IHC without DNA amplification, and had undergone multiple prior lines of treatment.  With induction of trastuzumab and irinotecan treatment, tumor regression was observed with progression free survival of 4.5 months.  Case 2 involved a 68 year old never-smoker with relapsed SCLC.  Tumor showed HER2 positive SCLC cells with no amplification or mutation.  Third line trastuzumab plus irinotecan brought about some symptom improvement and PFS of 3.5 months.  While the efficacy of trastuzumab against NSCLC with elevated levels of wild-type HER2 expression remains unclear, the authors conclude that trastuzumab based therapy is a promising strategy for chemo-resistant SCLC.
169	ALK	EML4::ALK C1156Y	C	Lorlatinib	Sensitivity/Response	Case report of a patient with metastatic ALK-rearranged NSCLC after progression under sequential crizotinib, ceritinib, HSP90 inhibitor AUY922 and chemotherapy followed by crizotinib again. Third generation ALK inhibitor lorlatinib led to a partial response that lasted for 8 months. The C1156Y mutation was confirmed in a sample prior to initial crizotinib (<7% of cells), following crizotinib treatment (~50% of cells) and following lorlatinib resistance (100% of cells). However, a second ALK mutation (C1156Y & L1198F) was detected in the lorlatinib resistant tumor.
170	ALK	EML4::ALK C1156Y-L1198F	C	Lorlatinib	Resistance	Case report of a patient with metastatic ALK-rearranged NSCLC. After developing resistance to first and second line ALK inhibitors mediated by a C1156Y mutation, the patient had a partial response with the third generation ALK-inhibitor lorlatinib. The patient progressed on lorlatinib after 8 months, at which point whole exome sequencing revealed an EML4-ALK C1156Y–L1198F double mutation. In vitro, the double mutation was resistant to lorlatinib but sensitive to crizotinib. The patient was started on crizotinib again and had a clinical response that lasted for 6 months.
166	ALK	EML4::ALK C1156Y	C	Crizotinib	Resistance	In this case report, a patient with metastatic, ALK-rearranged NSCLC with C1156Y mutation had tumor progression under sequential treatment with first crizotinib, then ceritinib and finally AUY922. Subsequent chemotherapy (carboplatin–pemetrexed) was administered and the patient had a response for 6 months before progression. Exome sequencing revealed the C1156Y mutation was present in <7% of the pretreatment tumor and in ~50% of the crizotinib tumor prior to ceritinib therapy.
367	HAVCR2	OVEREXPRESSION	C	PD1 Inhibitor	Resistance	In a preclinical study in an immunocompetent mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, upregulation of alternative immune checkpoints, notably T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3, aka HAVCR2) was observed after progression under PD-1 antibody. A survival advantage was observed with the addition of a TIM-3 blocking antibody. Two patients who developed adaptive resistance to anti-PD-1 treatment also showed TIM-3 upregulation in blocking antibody-bound T cells at treatment failure.
167	ALK	EML4::ALK C1156Y	C	Luminespib	Resistance	In this case report, a patient with metastatic, ALK-rearranged NSCLC with C1156Y mutation had tumor progression under sequential treatment with first crizotinib, then ceritinib and finally AUY922. Subsequent chemotherapy (carboplatin–pemetrexed) was administered and the patient had a response for 6 months before progression. Exome sequencing revealed the C1156Y mutation was present in <7% of the pretreatment tumor and in ~50% of the crizotinib tumor prior to ceritinib therapy.
496	ALK	ALK FUSION I1171	C	Ceritinib	Sensitivity/Response	A 51 year old female never smoker was diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC with liver metastases, and had adverse response to crizotinib treatment, after which she responded to alectinib until disease progressed after 5 months with new liver metastases. Liver tumor biopsy was taken and estimated to be 15% tumor. Hybrid capture next generation sequencing was performed and an I1171N mutation was found in rearranged ALK, and estimated to be in 33% of the tumor cells. Ceritinib was given at 750 mg once daily but dose reduction to 600 mg once daily was required due to persistent nausea. CT showed regression of liver lesions and primary lung lesion and ongoing response was seen at 3 months.
495	ALK	ALK FUSION I1171	C	Alectinib	Resistance	A 51 year old female never-smoker was diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC with liver metastases. ALK rearrangement was verified via FISH. She was treated with crizotinib at 250 mg twice daily but discontinued due to adverse response. She then started alectinib at 600 mg twice daily with partial response, but new liver metastases then formed at 5 months. Liver tumor biopsy was performed and was estimated to be 15% tumor tissue. Next-generation sequencing discovered an ALK I1171N mutation. The tumor was not sequenced prior to alectinib resistance.
520	MTOR	E2014K AND E2419K	C	Everolimus	Sensitivity/Response	"A phase 1 clinical trial identified a patient with chemotherapy-refractory urothelial carcinoma who had complete radiographic response lasting 14 months after combined everolimus and pazopanib treatment. This patient was exome sequenced and two mutations co-occurring in MTOR were identified. Expression of these mutations in HEK293T cells demonstrated these were activating mutations. The authors propose that these two activating mutations are the reason for the dramatic response to mTOR inhibition and considered them as ""biologically plausible"" to confer sensitivity to everolimus."
493	ALK	ALK FUSION G1202R	C	Crizotinib	Resistance	A patient with ALK-rearranged lung adenocarcinoma responded to crizotinib treatment and then had relapse. Biopsy was taken within half a month and total DNA was extracted from the sample. Exons 20-28, which correspond to the tyrosine kinase domain of ALK, were sequenced, and ALK G1202A was found. CKIT focal amplification by FISH was also observed. Tumor sample before crizotinib treatment was not available in this case.
673	MSH6	LOSS	C	Anti-PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody MEDI0680	Sensitivity/Response	Case report of a 45-year old woman of Japanese descent with recurrent urothelial carcinoma. The patient was identified to harbor mutations in MSH2 (A913fs*2, E226*, E580*) and in MSH6 (R361H) by panel sequencing as well as loss of expression of these genes as confirmed by IHC. Testing also revealed a high mutational load as well as 2+ PD-L1 expression in 80% of the cells. The patient was treated with anti-PD-L1 inhibitor MEDI4736 and MEDI0680 in a phase 1 trial and had a complete remission within 2 months of treatment that was ongoing after 11 months.
325	ERBB2	KINASE DOMAIN MUTATION	C	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	This was a retrospective study of patients with advanced HER2-mutant NSCLC who had undergone varied courses of treatment.  All tumors were adenocarcinoma with in-frame HER2 exon 20 insertions.  In patients (n=57) that had been treated with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, an overall response rate of 75% and progression free survival of 5.1 months were observed.  No standard of care currently exists for HER2-mutant NSCLC.  While trastuzumab has not shown clear benefit yet in wild-type HER2 overexpressed NSCLC, the authors conclude that further prospective studies should be done with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in advanced HER2 mutant NSCLC, and that trastuzumab plus chemotherapy should be considered in current treatment courses of this cancer type.
672	MSH6	LOSS	C	Durvalumab	Sensitivity/Response	Case report of a 45-year old woman of Japanese descent with recurrent urothelial carcinoma. The patient was identified to harbor mutations in MSH2 (A913fs*2, E226*, E580*) and in MSH6 (R361H) by panel sequencing as well as loss of expression of these genes as confirmed by IHC. Testing also revealed a high mutational load as well as 2+ PD-L1 expression in 80% of the cells. The patient was treated with anti-PD-L1 inhibitor MEDI4736 and MEDI0680 in a phase 1 trial and had a complete remission within 2 months of treatment that was ongoing after 11 months.
526	PDGFRA	FIP1L1::PDGFRA T674I	C	Imatinib	Resistance	A patient treated with imatinib for a FIP1L1-PDGFRA mutation relapsed during treatment. A T674I mutation in the PDGFRA split kinase domain was hypothesized to confer resistance, due to the strong evidence of this fusion in driving myeloproliferative hypereosinophilic syndrome and the contextual similarity to T315I mutations in BCR-ABL.
525	ROS1	REARRANGEMENT	C	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	Study describes a 31-year old male, never-smoker patient with advanced NSCLC with a ROS1 rearrangement. The patient was treated with crizotinib with marked response at 1 week and resolution of the tumor confirmed at 8 and 12 weeks via CT-scans. It was also demonstrated that crizotinib inhibits ROS1 phosphorylation in HEK 293 cells transfected with a CD14-ROS1 fusion gene, and crizotinib inhibited growth in the HCC78 cell line containing a ROS1 rearrangement to a similar degree as ALK-fusion positive cell lines.
524	RICTOR	AMPLIFICATION	C	Onatasertib	Sensitivity/Response	Study describes an 18 year old never smoker patient presenting with lung adenocarcinoma. A genomic profiling assay (FoundationOne) revealed a 7-copy amplification of RICTOR as the only somatic alteration. RICTOR amplification was confirmed via FISH and IHC. On two separate treatments with dual mTOR1/2 inhibitors patient exhibited stable disease for more than 18 months.
523	RICTOR	AMPLIFICATION	C	Sapanisertib	Sensitivity/Response	Study describes an 18 year old never smoker patient presenting with lung adenocarcinoma. A genomic profiling assay (FoundationOne) revealed a 7-copy amplification of RICTOR as the only somatic alteration. RICTOR amplification was confirmed via FISH and IHC.

Reduction of PDFGRA expression by shRNA decreased cell number similarly to sunitinib treatment. Additionally, targeting the PDGFRA ligand, PDGFC, with shRNA or antibody decreased cell number similarly to sunitinib treatment.

Phosphorylation of FLT3 and its downstream targets were rapidly inhibited in MV4-11 cells relative to control treatment (DMSO). In a mouse xenograft model using MV4-11 cells, increasing doses of gilteritinib further reduced tumor size and growth and inhibited phosphorylation of both FLT3 and STAT5 (N=6, p<0.05 at lowest dose). Gilteritinib inhibited growth in vitro of Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-ITD (IC50 1.8nM; 95% CI: 1.0-3.0 nM) and in vivo as tumor maintenance or shrinkage was also significant in mice xenografted with Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cells (N=5, p<0.001). Mice receiving an intra-bone marrow injection of MV4-11 cells labelled with luciferase began gilteritinib treatment on day 15.

The study found that dactolisib and lapatinib were effective in inhibiting outgrowth of PIK3CA amplified cells as monotherapies. Combination therapy produced similar abrogation of growth for PIK3CA amplified cells. Additionally, growth of untransduced BT-474 control cells was prevented by treatment with any monotherapy or combination of lapatinib or dactolisib.

Authors found that loss of PTEN expression induced resistance to trastuzumab as assessed by colony formation assay compared to PTEN expressing control cells. Among trastuzumab treated cells, concentration of phosphorylated AKT (S473 and T308) was higher in PTEN knockdown cells compared to PTEN expression cells, by western blot.
1302	PTEN	LOSS	D	Lapatinib	Resistance	In a preclinical study, efficacy of trastuzumab monotherapy was evaluated in vitro against HER2 amplified human breast cancer cell line BT474 (heterozygous for PIK3CA K111N) with shRNA-induced PTEN expression loss. Authors found that loss of PTEN expression induced resistance to lapatinib as assessed by colony formation assay compared to PTEN expressing control cells. Among lapatinib treated cells, concentration of phosphorylated AKT and ERK was substantially higher in cells with PTEN loss compared to PTEN expressing cells, by western blot. Furthermore, athymic nude mice injected with PTEN non-expressing BT474 cells had significantly higher mean tumor volume following lapatinib monotherapy compared to mice injected with PTEN expressing BT474. Authors conclude that loss of PTEN expression confers resistance to lapatinib in HER2 positive breast cancer cells.
1303	PTEN	LOSS	D	Dactolisib	Resistance	In a preclinical study, efficacy of dactolisib monotherapy was evaluated in vitro against HER2 amplified human breast cancer cell line BT474 (heterozygous for PIK3CA K111N) with shRNA-induced PTEN expression loss. PTEN loss resulted in partial rescue from the strong dactolisib induced reduction of colony formation that was seen in BT474 cells with unperturbed PTEN. Among cells treated with dactolisib (100nmol/L), those lacking PTEN expression demonstrated higher concentrations of phosphorylated AKT (S473) and phosphorylated ERK compared to PTEN expressing cells.
35	ALK	ALK FUSION G1202R	D	Crizotinib	Resistance	The G1202R mutation in the EML4-ALK fusion was found to confer resistance to crizotinib in Ba/F3 cells.
1304	PTEN	LOSS	D	Lapatinib	Resistance	In a preclinical study, efficacy of NVP-BEZ235 (dactolisib; a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor) and lapatinib combination therapy was evaluated in vitro against HER2 amplified breast cancer cell line BT474 (heterozygous for PIK3CA K111N) with shRNA-induced PTEN expression loss. Authors found that while PTEN loss induced resistance to lapatinib, combination with dactolisib produced an additive anti-proliferation effect. Western blot analysis of lapatinib and dactolisib combination treated cells showed a decrease in phosphorylated AKT and S6 relative to untreated and lapatinib treated control cells. Authors concluded that addition of dactolisib to lapatinib overcame PTEN loss induced lapatinib resistance in HER-2 positive breast cancer cells.
1306	PTEN	LOSS	D	Dactolisib	Resistance	In a preclinical study, efficacy of NVP-BEZ235 (dactolisib; a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor) and trastuzumab combination therapy was evaluated in vitro against HER2 amplified human breast cancer cell line BT474 (heterozygous for PIK3CA K111N) with shRNA-induced PTEN expression loss.

1307	PTEN	LOSS	D	Trastuzumab	Resistance	In a preclinical study, efficacy of NVP-BEZ235 (dactolisib; a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor) and trastuzumab combination therapy was evaluated in vitro against HER2 amplified human breast cancer cell line BT474 (heterozygous for PIK3CA K111N) with shRNA-induced PTEN expression loss. Authors found that while PTEN loss induced resistance to trastuzumab, combination with dactolisib produced an additive anti-proliferation effect.
32	IGF2	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Linsitinib	Sensitivity/Response	OSI-906, an IGF1R/INSR inhibitor, sensitizes cell lines to docetaxel and cabazitaxel, resulting in better overall survival in mouse xenografts of patient derived chemotherapy resistant castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines.
31	IGF2	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Docetaxel	Sensitivity/Response	OSI-906, an IGF1R/INSR inhibitor, sensitizes cell lines to docetaxel and cabazitaxel, resulting in better overall survival in mouse xenografts of patient derived chemotherapy resistant castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines.
30	IGF2	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Linsitinib	Sensitivity/Response	Increased IGF2 expression was shown to mediate chemotherapy resistance in several prostate cancer cell lines. The IGF1R/INSR inhibitor OSI-906 did not have a significant effect on chemotherapy resistant castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines, as measured by colony formation assay. Similarly, in vivo experiments showed no difference between OSI-906 and control treatment in terms of tumor growth and survival.
1313	KRAS	WILDTYPE	D	Regorafenib	Resistance	In an in vitro study, a human colon adenocarcinoma SW48 cell line expressing KRAS wildtype did not demonstrate resistance to regorafenib treatment (IC50: 114.28 nM) compared to SW48 cells expressing various common KRAS G12/G13 mutations. Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability. In vivo, SW48 cells were injected into NOD/SCID mice. Treatment with regorafenib did not lead to a significant delay of tumor growth, although KRAS wt mice trended toward better response than KRAS G12C expressing mice. IHC analysis of mouse tissue revealed more pronounced changes in markers of proliferation (Ki67), angiogenesis (CD31), and apoptosis (TUNEL) in KRAS wt mice treated with regorafenib compared to KRAS G12C mice whose tumors did not display changes in these markers. Authors concluded that KRAS wildtype was not resistant to regorafenib compared to other common KRAS G12/G13 mutations.
24	GATA2	EXPRESSION	D	Bortezomib	Sensitivity/Response	Targeting overactive GATA2-mediated pathways with inhibitors bortezomib and fasudil led to dramatic tumor regression.
1305	PTEN	LOSS	D	Dactolisib	Resistance	In a preclinical study, efficacy of NVP-BEZ235 (dactolisib; a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor) and lapatinib combination therapy was evaluated in vitro against HER2 amplified breast cancer cell line BT474 (heterozygous for PIK3CA K111N) with shRNA-induced PTEN expression loss. Authors found that while PTEN loss induced resistance to lapatinib, combination with dactolisib produced an additive anti-proliferation effect. Western blot analysis of lapatinib and dactolisib combination treated cells showed a decrease in phosphorylated AKT and S6 relative to untreated and lapatinib treated control cells. Authors concluded that addition of dactolisib to lapatinib overcame PTEN loss induced lapatinib resistance in HER-2 positive breast cancer cells.

Sensitivity was determined by assessing cell proliferation using the MTT assay.
64	LRP1B	EXON 12-22 DELETION	D	Doxorubicin	Resistance	A minimum common region of deletion of 0.19Mb, encompassing exons 12–22 of LRP1B4 was observed in 4 patients exhibiting acquired treatment resistance. Transfection of mLRP1B4, a fully functional minigene of LRP1B, in IGROV1 and OVCAR4 ovarian cell lines with low expression of LRP1B4 increased sensitivity to liposomal doxorubicin but not doxorubicin. siRNA knockdown of LRP1B4 in JHOS3 and Kuramochi ovarian cancer cell lines decreased sensitivity to liposomal doxorubicin but not doxorubicin.
1188	SMARCA4	LOSS	D	Palbociclib	Sensitivity/Response	Preclinical evidence showing that SMARCA4 inactivation results in downregulation of Cyclin D1 in NSCLC cells and confers sensitivity of such to CDK4/6 inhibitors. SMARCA4 loss is synthetic letha with CDK4/6 inhibition.
118	NRG1	EXPRESSION	D	Paclitaxel	Sensitivity/Response	In-vivo studies of residual NSCLC tumors (xenografts of 5 cell lines) after chemotherapy found increased EGFR-family signaling and NRG1 expression. NRG1 inhibition (YW538.24.71 antibody) led to decreased tumor growth and enhanced magnitude and response to chemotherapy.
117	NRG1	EXPRESSION	D	Seribantumab	Sensitivity/Response	An NRG1-ERBB3 autocrine signal-transducing loop was identified in a subset of ovarian cancers and cell lines. Disruption of this loop led to decreased cell-growth in-vitro and prolonged survival in-vivo. An ERBB3 directed antibody (MM-121) inhibited tumor-growth in-vivo.
116	NRG1	EXPRESSION	D	Cetuximab	Resistance	NRG1 upregulation or ERBB2 amplification were the main causes of resistance to cetuximab in-vivo and in-vitro in this study. Inhibition of ERBB2/ERBB3 signaling restored cetuximab sensitivity.
115	NRG1	EXPRESSION	D	Lapatinib	Sensitivity/Response	In non-HER2 amplified cell lines, sensitivity to HER2 kinase inhibitor lapatinib was found mainly in cell-lines with elevated NRG1 expression and HER3 activation. This aberration was mainly identified in head and neck cancer cell lines.
1193	ABL2	FUSION	D	Dasatinib	Sensitivity/Response	The ABL2-RCSD1 fusion was identified in a 5 yo boy with Ph-like B-ALL and Klinefelter syndrome. Following standard induction therapy the patient had an MRD of 1.2% in bone marrow, and continued to be MRD positive at 6 months off therapy (0.029%). He received imatinib and a bone marrow performed 2 months later showed no MRD. He maintained remission at one year post-diagnosis, on chemotherapy and imatinib. In addition, this study reports that expression of the ABL2-RCSD1 fusion protein in murine Ba/F3 cells promotes cytokine-independent proliferation and viable cells were reduced following exposure to dasatinib.
114	PTEN	EXPRESSION	D	Dacomitinib	Sensitivity/Response	In this preclinical study, the EGFR inhibitor dacomitinib had an effect on cell viability, self-renewal and proliferation in EGFR amplified GBM cells in-vitro and in-vivo (with or without the EGFRvIII mutation). It was less effective in one cell-line with PTEN deletion.
1201	FLT3	ITD	D	Ponatinib	Sensitivity/Response	In a preclinical trial, multiple experiments testing the effectiveness of ponatinib on the mutation FLT3-ITD in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were conducted. Ponatinib was very effective in targeting the FLT3-ITD mutation in MV4-11 cell lines (growth inhibition: IC50=2 nmol/L) compared to native FLT3 in RS4;11 cell lines (IC50>100 nmol/L). Additionally, MV4-11 cell lines incubated for 1 hour were shown to have reduced phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases beginning at a ponatinib concentration of 0.3 nmol/L. Ponatinib was shown to induce apoptotic mechanisms measured by caspase-3/7 activity in MV4-cell lines. In mice with the MV4-11 xenograft, ponatinib was very effective in targeting the FLT3-ITD mutation, as dosages of 1-5 mg/kg led to tumor growth inhibition and regression, while dosages of 10 and 25 mg/kg led to complete tumor regression. In primary blast cells from AML patients, Ponatinib was selectively effective in growth inhibition of the FLT3-ITD patient cells (n=1, IC50=4nmol/L) when compared to the native FLT3 patient cells (n=3, IC50>100nmol/L).
1202	FGFR1	FUSION	D	Sunitinib	Sensitivity/Response	In a preclinical trial, the AML cell line KG1 with the FGFR1OP2-FGFR1 fusion mutation was treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) ponatinib, sorafenib, and sunitinib. Ponatinib was much more effective in the growth inhibition of cells harboring the fusion mutation (IC50=17 nmol/L) compared to sorafenib (IC50>100 nmol/L) and sunitinib (IC50>100 nmol/L).
1203	FGFR1	FUSION	D	Sorafenib	Sensitivity/Response	In a preclinical trial, the AML cell line KG1 with the FGFR1OP2-FGFR1 fusion mutation was treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) ponatinib, sorafenib, and sunitinib.

1204	FLT3	ITD	D	Sorafenib	Sensitivity/Response	In a preclinical trial, the leukemic cell line MV4-11 with the FLT3-ITD mutation and the leukemic cell line RS4;11 with the native FLT3 gene were treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) ponatinib, sorafenib, and sunitinib. Ponatinib was similarly effective in the growth inhibition of cells harboring the FLT3-ITD mutation (IC50=2 nmol/L) compared to sorafenib (IC50=4 nmol/L) and sunitinib (IC50=12 nmol/L). Conversely, all three TKIs each were not effective in the growth inhibition of cells with native FLT3 (IC50>100 nmol/L).
1205	FLT3	ITD	D	Sunitinib	Sensitivity/Response	In a preclinical trial, the leukemic cell line MV4-11 with the FLT3-ITD mutation and the leukemic cell line RS4;11 with the native FLT3 gene were treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) ponatinib, sorafenib, and sunitinib. Ponatinib was similarly effective in the growth inhibition of cells harboring the FLT3-ITD mutation (IC50=2 nmol/L) compared to sorafenib (IC50=4 nmol/L) and sunitinib (IC50=12 nmol/L). Conversely, all three TKIs each were not effective in the growth inhibition of cells with native FLT3 (IC50>100 nmol/L).

155	EGF	EXPRESSION	D	Cetuximab	Resistance	3 tongue cancer cell lines were used for this study. Addition of recombinant human EGF led to increased cetuximab resistance. EGF downregulation suppressed proliferation of cell lines. Results for amphiregulin and epiregulin were inconclusive.
154	CD44	CD44S EXPRESSION	D	RG7356	Sensitivity/Response	CD44 isoform expression (especially CD44s) was identified to predict response to CD44 antibody RG7356 preclinically. Retrospective evaluation of 13 patients from a phase 1 study, treated with RG7356, identified 3 patients with CD44s isoform. 2/3 patients with CD44s had SD as best response. Overall, 5 patients had an OR.
146	DNMT1	EXPRESSION	D	Decitabine	Sensitivity/Response	DNMT1 expression (mRNA expression from an independent study) correlated with sensitivity to decitabine (ρ, −0.443, Pearson regression analysis) in this preclinical study of 45 solid tumor cell lines. DNMT1 protein expression was also evaluated in two KRAS-mutant ovarian cancer cell lines pre and post-decitabine treatment showing downregulation following treatment.
141	PTPRT	PROMOTER HYPERMETHYLATION	D	Stattic	Sensitivity/Response	PTPRT promoter hypermethylation was associated with increased sensitivity to STAT3 inhibition in this preclinical study in HNSCC.

135	CBLC	EXPRESSION	D	Olaparib	Resistance	The E3 ubiquitin ligase, CBLC, was identified as a candidate biomarker for olaparib sensitivity in a siRNA screen and further validated in-vitro. In other words, expression of CBLC is predicted to confer resistance to olaparib.
97	MYCN	AMPLIFICATION	D	FACT Complex-targeting Curaxin CBL0137	Sensitivity/Response	The drug CBL0137 (a drug that interacts with SSRP1 aka FACT) exhibited a synergistic effect with standard chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, etoposide, cisplatin, vincristine, etc.) by blocking repair of DNA damage caused by genotoxic drugs, thus creating a synthetic lethal environment in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells. High MYCN expression was found to sensitize neuroblastoma cells to CBL0137.
134	FGFR3	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Dovitinib	Sensitivity/Response	The effects of FGFR inhibitors (PD173074, TKI-258 and SU5402) in bladder carcinoma cell lines were related to FGFR3 (and/or FGFR1) expression.
132	FGFR3	OVEREXPRESSION	D	PD173074	Sensitivity/Response	The effects of FGFR inhibitors (PD173074, TKI-258 and SU5402) in bladder carcinoma cell lines were related to FGFR3 (and/or FGFR1) expression.

127	MAPK1	AMPLIFICATION	D	WZ4002	Resistance	Resistance to WZ4002 was induced in cell lines. Amplification of MAPK1 or downregulation of ERK-pathway inhibitors led to resistance to EGFR inhibition with WZ4002. Chemical inhibition (MEK inhibition with either CI-1040 or GSK1120212) or shRNA knockdown of MAPK1 resensitized cells to EGFR inhibition with WZ4002 in-vitro. Additionally, MAPK1 amplification was identified in 1/21 erlotinib-resistant NSCLC patients. MAPK1 amplification was not observed in the pretreatment tumor, only the post-treatment resistant tumor which lacked other more common drug-resistance mechanisms EGFR T790M or MET amplification.
122	AREG	EXPRESSION	D	Crizotinib	Resistance	A cell line (DFCI076) with EML1-ALK fusion and resistance mutation L1152R showed no response to ALK inhibition with crizotinib or TAE684. There was co-dependancy on AKT and EGFR-signaling and inhibition of both pathways led to decreased cell-growth. Amphiregulin (AREG) production was identified as a potential mediator of EGFR-activation (no other alterations detectable). The same mechanism could be reproduced in a cell line (H3122) without EML1-ALK mutation and resistance to crizotinib that was acquired in-vitro.

The patient's cells were sensitive to Ponatinib and Axitinib and insensitive to Nilotinib, Imatinib, and Dasatinib compared to BM MNCs from healthy controls using drug sensitivity scoring of proliferation assays. Additionally, in a rezasurin proliferation assay, Ba/F3 cells carrying the BCR-ABL1 variant were resistant to imatinib in fusions with the T315I variant of ABL1 compared to wildtype ABL1 (IC50 of >4,000 nM vs. 257 nM).
1236	ABL1	BCR::ABL E255K V299L	D	Ponatinib	Sensitivity/Response	Bone marrow mononuclear cells isolated from a chronic myeloid leukemia patient with the BCR-ABL1 fusion and E255K and V299L secondary variants in ABL1 showed a high drug sensitivity score to ponatinib and dasatinib.

86	PTEN	LOSS	D	Alpelisib	Resistance	A case report described a responder to PI3K inhibitor BYL719 for a tumor with PIK3CA E542K mutation. After partial response for 9.5 months, resistance developed. Sequencing in this and other patients as well as preclinical models showed loss of PTEN as the probable mechanism of resistance.
82	PTEN	LOSS	D	PI3Kbeta Inhibitor AZD8186	Sensitivity/Response	Breast and prostate cancer cell lines responsive to AZD8186 were enriched for PTEN deficiency.
1240	CDK4	EXPRESSION	D	Dexamethasone	Sensitivity/Response	CDK4 was found to be significantly overexpressed in the bone marrow of MLL-rearranged B-ALL patients (n=70) compared to normal bone marrow (n=74, p<.001). Combination treatment with dexamethasone (glucocorticoid) and Ribociclib (a highly selective CDK4 / CDK6 inhibitor) of both glucocorticoid sensitive (Rs4;11 & NALM6) and glucocorticoid resistant (RCH-ACV & SEM) B-ALL cell lines synergistically reduced cell viability of all four lines greater than individual drug exposures. Combination therapy also synergistically reduced the cell viability of 5 primary B-ALL lines derived from diagnosis bone marrow compared to individual treatment. (Note: Expression of CDK4 was not quantitatively measured in the derived and primary B-ALL lines used). Further investigation in RCH-ACV and SEM lines revealed dexamethasone and Ribociclib combined increased apoptosis (annexin-V) and increased G1 arrest along with increased p16 (a CDK4 & CDK6 inhibitor) and decreased phosphorylation of downstream G1 to S cell cycle progression markers compared to single treatments. Combination treatment also led to the increase of NR3C1 expression. Knockdown of CDK4 and CDK6 by siRNAs in RCH-ACV sensitized these cells to dexamethasone treatment and increased NR3C1 expression.

769	ABL1	BCR::ABL M351T	D	Imatinib	Sensitivity/Response	A panel of 18 mutations representing 85% of known mutations seen in imatinib CML patents were used to evaluate the effectiveness of drug binding. All mutations were compared with non-mutated BCR-ABL protein and were grouped according to their anti-proliferative activity. Mutant cell lines that exhibited a greater than 4-fold increase in IC50 value were considered resistant to drug, 2-4 fold increase in IC50 were moderately resistant and less than 2-fold change in IC50 was sensitive to drug treatment.

614	GAS6	EXPRESSION	D	Docetaxel	Resistance	Prostate Cancer (PCa) cell lines were either cultured alone, co-cultured with osteoblasts expressing GAS6, or cultured in the presence of media with GAS6 to examine their response to therapy with docetaxel. Docetaxel efficiently induced apoptosis in the cells cultured without any GAS6, but it was not able to do so in the cells that were in media with GAS6 present or that were co-cultured with osteoblasts expressing GAS6. PCa cells in the presence of GAS6 were found to be in G1 phase for a greater duration which may help explain the increased resistance to docetaxel.

The H396R mutation was resistant to imatinib.
604	FBXW7	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	D	Sirolimus	Sensitivity/Response	FBXW7 was shown to target mTOR for ubiquitination and degradation.  A reciprocal relationship between FBXW7 or PTEN loss was identified in breast cancer tumors and cell lines (mutual exclusivity of these two events).  In total only 4 out of 450 tumor and cell line samples had concomitant loss of both genes (p=4.9x10^-7). Cell lines (n=5) with FBXW7 mutations or deletions were significantly sensitive to rapamycin and downregulation of FBXW7 (shRNA) increased the sensitivity to rapamycin. In summary, this evidence suggests that FBXW7 may be a biomarker for cancers sensitivity to inhibitors of the mTOR pathway.
603	CCNE1	AMPLIFICATION	D	Palbociclib	Resistance	Preclinical study in breast cancer cell lines treated with CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib. Cell lines with acquired resistance to palbociclib were developed. Two palbociclib-resistant cell lines were derived through chronic exposure to 1 μmol/L palbociclib during 3 to 4 months. Copy number profiling from exome sequencing of MCF-7 and MCF-7pR, confirmed relative amplification of CCNE1. Silencing of CCNE1 or CDK2 alone in MCF-7pR cells had no effect on cell-cycle arrest, but resulted in substantially increased cell-cycle arrest and reduction in cell growth in combination with palbociclib.
785	ABL1	BCR::ABL F486S	D	Nilotinib	Sensitivity/Response	In an in vitro study, a Ba/F3 cell line stably expressing the F486S mutation in the ABL1 portion of the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein was associated with sensitivity to nilotinib treatment (IC50: 1.85-fold), comparable to Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL fusion protein. Sensitivity was determined by assessing cell proliferation.
804	FGFR1	EXPRESSION	D	FGFR Inhibitor AZD4547	Sensitivity/Response	Targeting of FGFR1 by RNA interference and small-molecule inhibitors (PD173074, AZD4547, BGJ398) revealed that the requirement for FGFR1 signaling in STS cells is dictated by FGFR1 expression levels, and identified the MAPK-ERK1/2 axis as critical FGFR1 effector pathway.
763	ABL1	BCR::ABL F317L	D	Nilotinib	Resistance	In an in vitro study, a Ba/F3 cell line stably expressing the F317L mutation in the ABL1 portion of the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein was associated with similar sensitivity to nilotinib and bafetinib treatment (IC50: 929.8 nM and 293.5 nM) as compared to wild-type BCR-ABL1 expressing Ba/F3 cells (IC50: 642.3 nM and 152.9 nM). Sensitivity was determined by assessing cell proliferation using the MTT assay.
805	FGFR1	EXPRESSION	D	FGF/VEGF Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor	Sensitivity/Response	Targeting of FGFR1 by RNA interference and small-molecule inhibitors (PD173074, AZD4547, BGJ398) revealed that the requirement for FGFR1 signaling in STS cells is dictated by FGFR1 expression levels, and identified the MAPK-ERK1/2 axis as critical FGFR1 effector pathway.
807	FGFR1	EXPRESSION	D	Infigratinib	Sensitivity/Response	Targeting of FGFR1 by RNA interference and small-molecule inhibitors (PD173074, AZD4547, BGJ398) revealed that the requirement for FGFR1 signaling in STS cells is dictated by FGFR1 expression levels, and identified the MAPK-ERK1/2 axis as critical FGFR1 effector pathway.
832	CTNNB1	ACTIVATING MUTATION	D	Anti-CTLA-4 Monoclonal Antibody	Resistance	Activation of melanoma-cell-intrinsic WNT/β-catenin signalling pathway contributes to a lack of T-cell infiltration in melanoma. Molecular analysis of human metastatic melanoma samples revealed a correlation between activation of the WNT/β-catenin signalling pathway and absence of a T-cell gene expression signature. In autochthonous mouse melanoma models active β-catenin signalling results in T-cell exclusion and resistance to anti-PD-L1/anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody therapy.
833	MERTK	OVEREXPRESSION	D	UNC1062	Sensitivity/Response	Highest MERTK expression was observed in metastatic melanomas, followed by primary melanomas, and lowest in benign nevi. Over half of melanoma cell lines overexpressed MERTK compared with normal human melanocytes; however, overexpression did not correlate with mutations in BRAF or RAS. MERTK inhibition via shRNA reduced MERTK-mediated downstream signaling, reduced colony formation by up to 59%, and diminished tumor volume by 60% in a human melanoma murine xenograft model. Treatment of melanoma cells with UNC1062, a novel MERTK-selective small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, reduced activation of MERTK-mediated downstream signaling, induced apoptosis in culture, reduced colony formation in soft agar, and inhibited invasion of melanoma cells.
559	CDK6	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Fulvestrant	Sensitivity/Response	Four fulvestrant (estrogen receptor degrader) resistant cell lines were derived from parent fulvestrant sensitive ER+ MCF-7/SO.5 breast cancer cell line. Derivative cell lines showed some sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, and increased growth inhibition when treated with fulvestrant and palbociclib together.
835	MYC	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Cisplatin	Sensitivity/Response	A preclinical study to evaluate the efficacy of targeting the overexpressed CHEK1 cell cycle chekpoint kinase, including both miRNA and Prexasertib-induced inhibition. Both in vitro and in vivo, Prexasertib had strong single agent efficacy and augmented the effect of Olaparib or Cisplatin in either combination, including platinum-resistant models. CHEK1 and MYC overexpression were predictors of response.
836	MYC	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Prexasertib	Sensitivity/Response	A preclinical study to evaluate the efficacy of targeting the overexpressed CHEK1 cell cycle chekpoint kinase, including both miRNA and Prexasertib-induced inhibition. Both in vitro and in vivo, Prexasertib had strong single agent efficacy and augmented the effect of Olaparib or Cisplatin in either combination, including platinum-resistant models. CHEK1 and MYC overexpression were predictors of response.
837	MYC	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Olaparib	Sensitivity/Response	A preclinical study to evaluate the efficacy of targeting the overexpressed CHEK1 cell cycle chekpoint kinase, including both miRNA and Prexasertib-induced inhibition. Both in vitro and in vivo, Prexasertib had strong single agent efficacy and augmented the effect of Olaparib or Cisplatin in either combination, including platinum-resistant models. CHEK1 and MYC overexpression were predictors of response.
831	CTNNB1	ACTIVATING MUTATION	D	Anti-PD-L1 Monoclonal Antibody	Resistance	Activation of melanoma-cell-intrinsic WNT/β-catenin signalling pathway contributes to a lack of T-cell infiltration in melanoma. Molecular analysis of human metastatic melanoma samples revealed a correlation between activation of the WNT/β-catenin signalling pathway and absence of a T-cell gene expression signature. In autochthonous mouse melanoma models active β-catenin signalling results in T-cell exclusion and resistance to anti-PD-L1/anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody therapy.
558	CDK6	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Palbociclib	Sensitivity/Response	Four fulvestrant (estrogen receptor degrader) resistant cell lines were derived from parent fulvestrant sensitive ER+ MCF-7/SO.5 breast cancer cell line. Derivative cell lines showed some sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, and increased growth inhibition when treated with fulvestrant and palbociclib together.
840	EGFR	AMPLIFICATION	D	Rociletinib	Resistance	Evidence of wild-type allele-mediated resistance, a novel concept of acquired resistance in response to mutation-selective inhibitor therapy in cancer treatment. This study reports that the Src-AKT pathway contributes to acquired resistance to third generation EGFR TKIs. In addition, amplification of EGFR wild-type alleles but not mutant alleles was sufficient to confer acquired resistance.
841	EGFR	AMPLIFICATION	D	Osimertinib	Resistance	Evidence of wild-type allele-mediated resistance, a novel concept of acquired resistance in response to mutation-selective inhibitor therapy in cancer treatment. This study reports that the Src-AKT pathway contributes to acquired resistance to third generation EGFR TKIs. In addition, amplification of EGFR wild-type alleles but not mutant alleles was sufficient to confer acquired resistance.
843	MET	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Selumetinib	Resistance	In this study the authors screened for growth factors that elicited resistance in newly characterized metastatic uveal melanoma cell lines to clinical-grade MEK inhibitors, trametinib and selumetinib, showing that neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) provide resistance to MEK inhibition. Trametinib enhances the responsiveness to NRG1 and sustained HGF-mediated activation of AKT. Targeting ERBB3 and cMET could overcome resistance to trametinib.
844	MET	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Trametinib	Resistance	In this study the authors screened for growth factors that elicited resistance in newly characterized metastatic uveal melanoma cell lines to clinical-grade MEK inhibitors, trametinib and selumetinib, showing that neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) provide resistance to MEK inhibition. Trametinib enhances the responsiveness to NRG1 and sustained HGF-mediated activation of AKT. Targeting ERBB3 and cMET could overcome resistance to trametinib.
1037	TLK2	AMPLIFICATION	D	GF109203X	Sensitivity/Response	TLK2 inhibition selectively inhibits the growth of TLK2-high breast cancer cells, downregulates ERα, BCL2 and SKP2, impairs G1/S cell cycle progression, induces apoptosis and significantly improves progression-free survival in vivo.
552	PTEN	LOSS	D	Capivasertib	Sensitivity/Response	A patient derived mouse xenograft model was established with gastric cancer cells having PTEN loss. The xenograft was resistant to monotherapy with both the pan-Akt inhibitor AZD5363, and also to the commonly used gastric cancer chemotheraputic docetaxel. When used in combination, AZD5363 and docetaxel induced significant tumor growth inhibition in comparison to monotherapy and vehicle control.
556	NOTCH1	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	D	Porcupine Inhibitor WNT974	Sensitivity/Response	In an evaluation of 96 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines, 31 were responsive to LGK974 (PORCN inhibitor). Of 40 cell lines (25 responsive, 15 non-responsive) that were exome sequenced, 6 cell lines had NOTCH1 loss-of-function mutations (N-terminal frameshift/nonsense) and 5/6 cell lines that had NOTCH1 mutations were susceptible to LGK974 (PORCN inhibitor).
830	ARID1A	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	D	GSK126	Sensitivity/Response	Inhibition of the EZH2 methyltransferase acts in a synthetic lethal manner in ARID1A mutated ovarian cancer cells. ARID1A mutational status correlates with response to the EZH2 inhibitor. Significantly, EZH2 inhibition causes regression of ARID1A mutated ovarian tumors in vivo.
829	ARID1A	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	D	Dasatinib	Sensitivity/Response	High-throughput  drug screens in OCCC tumor cell model identified synthetic lethal (SL) interaction between the kinase inhibitor dasatinib and ARID1A mutation. Imposing ARID1A deficiency upon a variety of human or mouse cells induced dasatinib sensitivity, both in vitro and in vivo.
828	TP53	DELETERIOUS MUTATION	D	Rebemadlin	Resistance	MDM2 Inhibitor Nutlin-3a induced senescence in presence of functional TP53 in murine primary fibroblasts, oncogenically transformed fibroblasts, and fibrosarcoma cell lines. TP53 mutant cells lacking functional TP53 were completely insensitive to the drug.
588	PTEN	LOSS	D	Everolimus	Sensitivity/Response	In a panel of 31 breast cancer cell lines, 11 had loss of PTEN function. Cells were tested for sensitivity to mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus and mTORC1/2 inhibitor PP242, and no significant correlation was found between PTEN status and sensitivity to mTORC inhibition.
583	CCND1	AMPLIFICATION	D	Palbociclib	Sensitivity/Response	A panel of 40 ovarian cancer cell lines with varied mutation profiles was assayed for sensitivity to the cdk4/6 inhibitor palbociclib (PD0332991) via measurement of IC50 values for inhibition of proliferation. Large variation in palbociclib sensitivity was observed and cell lines (N=40) were classified as above (resistant) or below (sensitive) the mean log of all IC50 values. 6/18 (33%) of the resistant lines and in only 1/22 (5%) of the sensitive lines (P = 0.017) had CCND1 copy number gain. Increased CCND1 expression was not correlated with sensitivity to palbociclib (p=0.671).
582	RAD23B	EXPRESSION	D	Vorinostat	Sensitivity/Response	Western blot analyses were performed for HR23b (RAD23B) expression sarcoma cell lines after treatment with vorinostat, belinostat, mocetinostat and entinostat. All HDACi were able to regulate proliferation and apoptosis in vitro. Sensitivity to vorinostat correlated significantly with HR23b protein expression. IHC in 523 patient samples revealed high HR23b expression in 12.5% of sarcomas (among them malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours, pleomorphic liposarcomas, leiomyosarcomas, dedifferentiated liposarcomas, synovial sarcomas and angiosarcomas) and 23.2% of GIST.
581	RB1	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	D	Palbociclib	Resistance	A panel of 21 glioblastoma cell lines harboring various mutations was treated with palbociclib. 16 of the cell lines with intact Rb showed decreased proliferation (bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, BrdU flow cytometry) and growth arrest characteristic of senescence, while the 5 cell lines that did not show a palbociclib response had homozygous deletion of Rb. Rb positive and palbociclib responsive GBM cell line U87MG was treated with shRNA against Rb. shRb treated cells showed restoration of cell proliferation (BrdU incorporation) under palbociclib treatment, indicating resistance.
577	MET	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	c-MET and ligand HGF were expressed by 6 uveal melanoma cell lines in-vitro. GNA-mutant cell lines (n=3) showed stronger expression of ligand and receptor as well as more receptor phosphorylation. SiRNA mediated MET-knockdown reduced cell migration but not cell growth. Crizotinib treatment led to a decrease in cell growth and migration. At 25 nmol/L of crizotinib, only the migration of G-protein mutant cells lines and not G-protein wild type cell lines was decreased. Crizotinib did not lead to a reduction in tumor volume of two cell lines in vivo but reduced the formation of macrometastases (luciferase activity, p=0.03).
572	MET	AMPLIFICATION	D	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	2 MET amplified NSCLC cell lines (EBC-1 and H1993), as well as 2 EGFR mutant and 2 MET and EGFR wild type cell lines were treated with ALK and MET inhibitor crizotinib, and the MET amplified cells had IC50 100 fold lower than the non MET amplified cell lines. Both crizotinib treatment and siRNA against MET increased apoptotic markers in MET amplified cells but not controls, indicating that crizotinib targeting of amplified MET was inducing the apoptotic effects. Tumors caused by MET amplified EBC-1 cells injected into mice were significantly inhibited with crizotinib treatment, while tumors from non-MET amplified cells showed no substantial effect.
570	CCND1	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Palbociclib	Sensitivity/Response	In Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), t(11:14)-induced overexpression of cyclin D1 was targeted by CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib (PD0332991). Palbociclib caused Rb dephosphorylation in MCL cell lines and patient derived tumor cells. MCL cell lines overexpressing cyclin D1 showed growth inhibition with Palbociclib. The VAL DLBCL cell line was used as control to verify cyclin D1 overexpression but was not used as a control in Palbociclib inhibitor experiments. Instead, the investigators report that other publications report cell lines without cyclin D1 overexpression had higher IC50 values for palbociclib, suggesting overexpresssed cyclin D1 targetability in MCL.
569	CCND1	AMPLIFICATION	D	Palbociclib	Sensitivity/Response	A panel of 47 breast cancer cell lines was tested for sensitivty/resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib (PD0332991),  where IC50 below 150nM was sensitive, and above 1000nM resistant. Cyclin D1 had higher expression levels in sensitive cell lines.
568	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	D	Palbociclib	Sensitivity/Response	In a panel of 47 breast cancer cell lines, HER2 overexpressing cells were among those more sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib (PD0332991). In the trastuzumab sensitive cell line Bt474, palbociclib synergized with trastuzumab in growth inhibition, while in 2 trastuzumab resistant cell lines, addition of trastuzumab to palbociclib treatment resulted in increased growth inhibition over palbociclib alone.
567	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	D	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	In a panel of 47 breast cancer cell lines, HER2 overexpressing cells were among those more sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib (PD0332991). In the trastuzumab sensitive cell line Bt474, palbociclib synergized with trastuzumab in growth inhibition, while in 2 trastuzumab resistant cell lines, addition of trastuzumab to palbociclib treatment resulted in increased growth inhibition over palbociclib alone.
566	CCND1	AMPLIFICATION	D	Palbociclib	Sensitivity/Response	28 renal cell carcinoma cell lines were tested for sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib (PD0332991). 19 were reported sensitive, and 9 resistant. 15 of the 28 cell lines had high levels of Cyclin D1 (CCND1) expression which did not correlate significantly with palbociclib sensitivity (p=0.348).
823	TP53	WILDTYPE	D	Rebemadlin	Sensitivity/Response	MDM2 Inhibitor Nutlin-3a induced senescence in presence of functional TP53 in murine primary fibroblasts, oncogenically transformed fibroblasts, and fibrosarcoma cell lines. Cells lacking functional TP53 were completely insensitive to the drug.
824	TP53	WILDTYPE	D	MDM2 Inhibitor AMGMDS3	Sensitivity/Response	MDM2 Inhibitor screen in a panel of 260 cancer cell lines with well characterized TP53 status shows that only cancer cell lines with unaltered TP53 may be sensitive to MDM2 Inhibitor.
561	RB1	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	D	Palbociclib	Resistance	In 3 ER positive and 2 ER negative breast cancer cell lines with intact Rb, significant growth inhibition, as measured by BrdU incorporation, was seen with incubation in CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib (PD-0332991). In contrast, two ER negative cell lines lacking detectable Rb were fully resistant to palbociclib. Knockdown of Rb in 3 of the tested Rb positive cell lines led to moderate palbociclib resistance in short term incubation experiments.  In longer term (15 day) palbociclib incubations of ER negative MDA-MB-231 cells and ER positive MCF-7 cells, significant resistance to palbociclib was seen in Rb knockdown conditions while wild-type Rb cells maintained sensitivity.
827	TP53	DELETERIOUS MUTATION	D	MDM2 Inhibitor AMGMDS3	Resistance	MDM2 Inhibitor screen in a panel of 260 cancer cell lines with well characterized TP53 status shows that only cancer cell lines with unaltered TP53 may be sensitive to MDM2 Inhibitor AMGMDS3, while those with p53 mutations demonstrated resistance.
806	FGFR1	EXPRESSION	D	 PD173074	Sensitivity/Response	Targeting of FGFR1 by RNA interference and small-molecule inhibitors (PD173074, AZD4547, BGJ398) revealed that the requirement for FGFR1 signaling in STS cells is dictated by FGFR1 expression levels, and identified the MAPK-ERK1/2 axis as critical FGFR1 effector pathway.
551	PTEN	LOSS	D	Docetaxel	Sensitivity/Response	A patient derived mouse xenograft model was established with gastric cancer cells having PTEN loss. The xenograft was resistant to monotherapy with both the pan-Akt inhibitor AZD5363, and also to the commonly used gastric cancer chemotheraputic docetaxel. When used in combination, AZD5363 and docetaxel induced significant tumor growth inhibition in comparison to monotherapy and vehicle control.
760	ABL1	BCR::ABL F317L	D	Imatinib	Resistance	A panel of 18 mutations representing 85% of known mutations seen in imatinib CML patents were used to evaluate the effectiveness of drug binding. All mutations were compared with non-mutated BCR-ABL protein and were grouped according to their anti-proliferative activity. Mutant cell lines that exhibited a greater than 4-fold increase in IC50 value were considered resistant to drug, 2-4 fold increase in IC50 were moderately resistant and less than 2-fold change in IC50 was sensitive to drug treatment. The F317L mutation was moderately resistant to imatinib.
758	ABL1	BCR::ABL T315I	D	Bafetinib	Resistance	In an in vitro study, a Ba/F3 cell line stably expressing the T315I mutation in the ABL1 portion of the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein was associated with resistance to nilotinib, imatinib, dasatinib, and bafetinib (INNO-406) treatment (IC50: > 2000.0 nM) as compared to wild-type BCR-ABL1 expressing Ba/F3 cells (IC50: 642.3 nM, 1712 nM, 87.6 nM and 152.9 nM). Sensitivity was determined by assessing cell proliferation using the MTT assay.
654	PDGFRA	AMPLIFICATION	D	Sunitinib	Sensitivity/Response	In a high-throughput cell line screen of 637 cell lines, only 2 sunitinib sensitive cell lines were identified. In the sunitinib-sensitive adenosquamous NSCLC cell line (NCI-H1703), PDGFRA expression was associated with focal PDGFRA gene amplification. This alteration was detected in a small fraction of primary squamous cell NSCLC tumor specimens. Focal amplification of PDGFC, the gene encoding the PDGFR ligand, was also detected.
653	FGFR1	AMPLIFICATION	D	Ponatinib	Sensitivity/Response	In MDA-MB-134 cells (ER-positive breast cancer cells with amplified FGFR1) ponatinib potently inhibited cell growth with a GI50 value of 23 nmol/L and inhibited FGFR1 phosphorylation with an IC50 value of 7 nmol/L.
649	NF1	LOSS	D	JQ1 Compound	Sensitivity/Response	BRD4 inhibition supressess growth and tumorigenesis of NF1-/-, TP53-/- MPNST cells in mouse xenografts
648	NF2	LOSS	D	Selumetinib	Sensitivity/Response	NF2 loss promotes oncogenic RAS-signaling via YAP-dependent transactivation of RAS and sensitizes to MEK inhibition. The authors demonstrate this in (A) isogenic lines derived from C643 cells (HRASG13R, NF2-WT) modified to stably express shNF2, (B) in set of 7 RAS-mutant thyroid cancer cell lines that differ in their NF2 expression levels, and (C) in a Hras-G12V/Nf2-null mouse model.
647	SMARCB1	DELETION	D	Tazemetostat	Sensitivity/Response	EPZ-6438 (Tazemetostat) induces apoptosis and differentiation specifically in SMARCB1-deleted malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT) cells. This study compared in vitro EPZ-6438 treatment of four SMARCB1-deleted MRT cell lines to three control (wild-type) cell lines. These data demonstrate the dependency of SMARCB1 mutant MRTs on EZH2 enzymatic activity and suggest treatment of these genetically defined cancers with EZH2 inhibitors.
646	SMARCB1	UNDEREXPRESSION	D	Tazemetostat	Sensitivity/Response	Treatment with tazemetostat , a small-molecule inhibitor of EZH2, results in concentration-dependent cell growth inhibition and cell death specifically in SS18-SSX-positive, SMARCB1-deficient synovial sarcomas.
700	VPS37A	UNDEREXPRESSION	D	Cetuximab	Resistance	Vps37A-deficient ovarian cancer cells become irresponsive to inhibition by the therapeutic antibody cetuximab in-vitro.
709	PTEN	LOSS	D	Pictilisib	Sensitivity/Response	This preclinical study tested the efficacy of GDC-0941, a selective inhibitor of class I PI3K, on several cell lines of breast cancer. Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. HCC1569 is a PTEN null, HER2 amplified breast cancer cell line. It had an IC50 of 0.46. Authors note that HER2 amplified breast cancer cell lines are generally more sensitive to GDC-0941 than basal-type cell lines (p = 0.002).
711	PTEN	LOSS	D	Pictilisib	Sensitivity/Response	This preclinical study tested the efficacy of GDC-0941, a selective inhibitor of class I PI3K, on several cell lines of breast cancer. Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. The authors tested several basal and luminal cell lines harboring PTEN loss for sensitivity to GDC-0941. ZR-75-1, a luminal-type cell line, had an IC50 of 0.15uM and reduction in phosphorylated AKT was noted following administration of GDC-0941. EVSTA-T, a luminal-type cell line, had an IC50 of 0.36uM; treatment resulted in an relative increase of Sub-G and G phase cells from 49% to 78% of total cells evaluated; there was a 12fold increase in annexin V (an apoptotic marker), and a substantial reduction in phosphorylated AKT following GDC-0941 administration. Seven basal-like cell lines harbored PTEN loss and had IC50s ranging fom 0.30uM to 20.00uM (4/7 had IC50s greater than 1 uM). There was a varied reduction in phosphorylated AKT among basal-like cell lines. Authors note that PTEN status may have low predictive power for response, and suggested that other factors such as basal/luminal characteristics may be more informative for GDC-0941 response. Authors further note that luminal type cell lines are generally more sensitive to GDC-0941 than basal type cell lines (p=0.02).
645	CCNE1	AMPLIFICATION	D	Akt Inhibitor MK2206	Sensitivity/Response	A high throughput compound screen identified synergistic combinations in CCNE1 amplified high grade serous ovarian carcinoma, including dinaciclib and AKT inhibitors
713	ABL1	BCR::ABL F359V	D	Imatinib	Resistance	A panel of 18 mutations representing 85% of known mutations seen in imatinib CML patents were used to evaluate the effectiveness of drug binding. All mutations were compared with non-mutated BCR-ABL protein and were grouped according to their anti-proliferative activity. Mutant cell lines that exhibited a greater than 4-fold increase in IC50 value were considered resistant to drug, 2-4 fold increase in IC50 were moderately resistant and less than 2-fold change in IC50 was sensitive to drug treatment. The F359V mutation was moderately resistant to imatinib.
644	CCNE1	AMPLIFICATION	D	Dinaciclib	Sensitivity/Response	A high throughput compound screen identified synergistic combinations in CCNE1 amplified high grade serous ovarian carcinoma, including dinaciclib and AKT inhibitors
643	CCNE1	OVEREXPRESSION	D	CDK Inhibitor SNS-032	Sensitivity/Response	Four ovarian cancer cell lines with elevated CCNE1 expression were 40x more sensitive to Cdk2 inhibitor SNS-032 than four cell lines without CCNE1 overexpression. SNS-032 greatly prolonged the survival of mice with CCNE1 overexpressing xenografts.
716	ABL1	BCR::ABL F359V	D	Nilotinib	Resistance	In an in vitro study, a Ba/F3  cell line stably expressing the F359V mutation in the ABL1 portion of the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein was associated with resistance to nilotinib treatment (IC50: 5.16-fold), as compared to Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL1 fusion protein (reported to be sensitizing to nilotinib). Sensitivity was determined by assessing cell proliferation.
710	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	D	Pictilisib	Sensitivity/Response	This preclinical study tested the efficacy of GDC-0941, a selective inhibitor of class I PI3K, on several cell lines of breast cancer. Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. Authors tested six HER2 amplified breast cancer cell lines for sensitivity to GDC-0941. Their IC50s ranged from 0.19uM to 1.29uM (5/6 cell lines had IC50s below 1umol/L). Authors further note that HER2 amplified breast cancer cell lines are generally more sensitive to GDC-0941 than basal-type cell lines (p = 0.002).
699	MTAP	UNDEREXPRESSION	D	Pyrimidine Antagonist	Sensitivity/Response	MTAP and CDKN2A gene (RT-qPCR) and protein (western-blotting) expression as well as promoter methylation status were analyzed in breast cancer patients and seven breast cancer cell lines. Knockdown of MTAP in one cell line with strong endogenous MTAP expression (MDA-MB-435) increased sensitivity to inhibitors of de novo adenine synthesis (5-FU, AZA and MTX), mainly 5-FU.
698	MET	AMPLIFICATION	D	Cetuximab	Sensitivity/Response	Functional studies show that MET activation confers resistance to anti-EGFR therapy both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, in patient-derived colorectal cancer xenografts, MET amplification correlated with resistance to EGFR blockade, which could be overcome by MET kinase inhibitors.
697	MET	AMPLIFICATION	D	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	Functional studies show that MET activation confers resistance to anti-EGFR therapy both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, in patient-derived colorectal cancer xenografts, MET amplification correlated with resistance to EGFR blockade, which could be overcome by MET kinase inhibitors.
677	CDKN2B	LOSS	D	Linsitinib	Sensitivity/Response	A patient-derived xenograft (PDX) from a patient with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B (CDKN2A/B) loss and FUS-ERG fusion positive Ewing's sarcoma was created. The PDX was treated in four cohorts (each N=6) with control, doxorubicin, CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib or IGF-1R inhibitor linsitinib. Both linsitinib and palbociclib cohorts were significantly more effective than control and doxorubicin. Doxorubicin was part of the patient's treatment (Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with DOX, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide) and was noted by authors as failing to control tumor growth.
678	CDKN2A	LOSS	D	Palbociclib	Sensitivity/Response	An imatinib-resistant cell line, DFSP105, was established from a dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans which had progressed to a high-grade fibrosarcomatous DFSP. The disease-associated COL1A1-PDGFB fusion was consistent with the most common form, a supernumerary ring chromosome. Genetic characterization of the cell line with a SNP array identified a homozygous CDKN2A/B deletion. Treatment of this cell line with CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib led to growth inhibition and reduced RB1 phosphorylation in vitro and in-vivo.
674	CDKN2A	LOSS	D	Palbociclib	Sensitivity/Response	A patient-derived xenograft (PDX) from a patient with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B (CDKN2A/B) loss and FUS-ERG fusion positive Ewing's sarcoma was created. The PDX was treated in four cohorts (each N=6) with control, doxorubicin, CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib or IGF-1R inhibitor linsitinib. Both linsitinib and palbociclib cohorts were significantly more effective than control and doxorubicin.

634	SOX10	LOSS	D	Vemurafenib	Resistance	FACS-assisted shRNA genetic screen identified SOX10 as a determinant of vemurafenib resistance. Suppression of SOX10 in melanoma cells confers resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors through activation of TGF-β signalling and upregulation of EGFR and PDGFRB. EGFR expression or exposure to TGF-β becomes beneficial for proliferation of melanoma cells in the presence of BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Melanoma cells with low SOX10 and consequently high EGFR expression are enriched in the presence of vemurafenib. This study finds evidence for SOX10 loss (N=2) and/or activation of TGF-β signalling (N=2) in 4 of the 6 EGFR-positive drug-resistant melanoma patient samples.
735	ABL1	BCR::ABL Q252H	D	Nilotinib	Resistance	In an in vitro study, a Ba/F3 cell line stably expressing the Q252H mutation in the ABL1 portion of the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein was associated with similar sensitivity to dasatinib and nilotinib treatment (IC50: 62.3 nM and 895.5 nM) as compared to wild-type expressing Ba/F3 cells (IC50: 87.6 nM and 642.3 nM).

Resistant clones were also found at 2, 4, and 8 μM imatinib. In a review of 20 publications, this mutation was described in imatinib resistant patients.
638	SGK1	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Alpelisib	Resistance	SGK1 mRNA expression was elevated in five breast cancer cell lines which were resistant to PI3Kalpha inhibitor alpelisib (NVP-BYL719) in comparison to five sensitive cell lines. Western blots showed clear elevation of protein levels in 3/5 resistant cell lines. Ectopic SGK1 expression in sensitive MDA-MB-361 cells resulted in alpelisib resistance and preservation of phopho-S6K and phospho-4EBP with alpelisib treatment. Knockdown of SGK1 in resistant HCC1954 cells increased alpelisib sensitivity and reduced p-S6K and p-4EBP levels with alpelisib treatment. Promoter methylation at SGK1 was increased in sensitive cells compared to alpelisib resistant cell lines.
538	PTEN	LOSS	D	Cisplatin	Resistance	A cisplatin resistant derivative of ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-3 was generated by long term passage with increasing cisplatin levels.

553	PTEN	LOSS	D	Capivasertib	Sensitivity/Response	In a panel of 182 cell lines (162 with PIK3CA mutation status known) from solid and hematological tumors, significant correlation was found between AZD5363 (pan-Akt inhibitor) sensitivity and PIK3CA mutation status (N=33, p=0.0059). In the subpopulation free of RAS mutation (N=19) the correlation was increased.
532	PIK3CA	AMPLIFICATION	D	Taselisib	Sensitivity/Response	The HNSCC cell line LB771 with PIK3CA amplification was shown to have low antiproliferative IC50 for the p110beta-sparing PI3K inhibitor taselisib. Under increasing taselisib concentrations, reduction in phospho-Akt pro-survival signal was apparent, along with increased levels of pro-apoptotic marker cleaved PARP. A general tendency for taselisib sensitivity to PI3K activation (mutation/amplification) was also seen in a panel of 26 HNSCC cell lines
420	ROS1	CD74::ROS1 G2032R	D	Cabozantinib	Sensitivity/Response	Preclinical study analyzing the efficacy of dual ROS1/ALK and more specific ROS1 inhibitors on cell lines (Ba/F3) expressing CD74-ROS1 with and without the G2032R mutation. Selective ROS1 inhibitors retained activity against the G2032R mutation (cabozatinib, foretinib), whereas dual ALK/ROS inhibitors (crizotinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, AZD3463) or ALK-selective inhibitors (alectinib) were ineffective.
419	ROS1	CD74::ROS1 G2032R	D	Foretinib	Sensitivity/Response	Preclinical study analyzing the efficacy of dual ROS1/ALK and more specific ROS1 inhibitors on cell lines (Ba/F3) expressing CD74-ROS1 with and without the G2032R mutation. Selective ROS1 inhibitors retained activity against the G2032R mutation (cabozatinib, foretinib), whereas dual ALK/ROS inhibitors (crizotinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, AZD3463) or ALK-selective inhibitors (alectinib) were ineffective.
417	FGFR1	AMPLIFICATION	D	Ponatinib	Sensitivity/Response	116 Ewing's sarcoma tumor samples were analyzed in this study. 2 patient's samples underwent whole genome sequencing, tumor samples from 51 patients underwent exome sequencing and expression analysis, 63 samples underwent FGFR1 copy number analysis, mRNA analysis and IHC. A FGFR1 N546K mutation was detected in one patient. Gain of the FGFR1 locus (qPCR) was observed in 13 of 41 patients (31.7%) and Ewing sarcoma cell lines (A673, CADO, SK-NMC, SK-ES, and VH-64). FGFR1 was also highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma (mRNA and IHC) and correlated with copy number. Retroviral transduction of FGFR1 wild-type or the FGFR1 N546K mutant into NIH3T3 cells led to enhanced proliferation especially for cells harboring the FGFR1 mutation. ShRNA mediated knockdown of FGFR1 inhibited growth of Ewing sarcoma and other cancer cells (A549 lung carcinoma cell line or leukemia cell lines HL60 and Kasumi) with almost complete growth suppression only in the Ewing sarcoma cell lines and knockdown of FGFR1 abrogated growth of cell lines in xenograft. Ponatinib treatment inhibited growth of Ewing sarcoma cell lines.
412	ALK	EML4::ALK E6-E20	D	Alvespimycin	Sensitivity/Response	Transduction of Ba/F3 cells with EML4-ALK variant 3a caused the cells to grow independently of IL3 addition.  While incubation of Ba/F3 cells transduced with EML4-ALK variants 1 and 2 with Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG caused cell death that was reversible with IL3 addition, Ba/F3 cells with variant 3a were not sensitized to 17-DMAG induced death, suggesting that 17-DMAG was effecting the EML4-ALK driver of IL3-independant proliferation. This in turn suggests that variant 3a may not rely on Hsp90 for stability in cancer cells to the extent of other variants.
411	ALK	EML4::ALK E20-E20	D	Alvespimycin	Sensitivity/Response	EML4-ALK fusions occur in 2-7% of lung adenocarcinomas. Transduction of Ba/F3 cells with EML4-ALK variant 2 (EML4 exon 20 fused to ALK exon 20) caused the cells to grow independently of IL3 addition.  EML4-ALK may be a client protein of Hsp90. Addition of Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG to the EML4-ALK variant 2 cells induced cell death which was rescued at lower 17-DMAG concentrations by IL3 addition. This result suggests that 17-DMAG specifically  targeted the EML4-ALK driver in these cells. Finally, 17-DMAG and crizotinib showed a synergistic effect in killing EML4-ALK variant 2 cells.
410	ALK	EML4::ALK E20-E20	D	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	EML4-ALK fusions occur in 2-7% of lung adenocarcinomas. Transduction of Ba/F3 cells with EML4-ALK variant 2 (EML4 exon 20 fused to ALK exon 20) caused the cells to grow independently of IL3 addition.  EML4-ALK may be a client protein of Hsp90. Addition of Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG to the EML4-ALK variant 2 cells induced cell death which was rescued at lower 17-DMAG concentrations by IL3 addition. This result suggests that 17-DMAG specifically  targeted the EML4-ALK driver in these cells. Finally, 17-DMAG and crizotinib showed a synergistic effect in killing EML4-ALK variant 2 cells.
421	ROS1	CD74::ROS1 G2032R	D	Ceritinib	Resistance	Preclinical study analyzing the efficacy of dual ROS1/ALK and more specific ROS1 inhibitors on cell lines (Ba/F3) expressing CD74-ROS1 with and without the G2032R mutation. Selective ROS1 inhibitors retained activity against the G2032R mutation (cabozatinib, foretinib), whereas dual ALK/ROS inhibitors (crizotinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, AZD3463) or ALK-selective inhibitors (alectinib) were ineffective.
404	ALK	EML4::ALK E6-E20	D	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	Ba/F3 cells transduced with EML4-ALK variants v1 (E13;A20), v2 (E20;A20), v3a (E6;A20) and v3b (E6ins33;A20) showed differential sensitivity to both crizotinib and TAE684, with variant 3a (E6;A20) being the least sensitive. The authors suggest that the type/structure of ALK fusion may have some impact on patient outcome in targeted therapy.
402	ALK	EML4::ALK E6-E20	D	TAE684	Sensitivity/Response	Exon-array and RT-PCR was used to screen a panel of 83 NSCLC cell lines for EML4-ALK variants. The cell lines NCI-H3122 (containing EML4-ALK variant 1) and NCI-H2228 (containing the EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20 fusion-variant 3a/3b) were identified. TAE684 (0.1uM) appreciably inhibited growth as well as Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation in variant 1 containing H3122 cells. However, incomplete inhibition in 3a/3b containing H2228 cells was observed. H2228 growth inhibition by TAE684 was more similar to NSCLC cell lines harboring KRAS and EGFR mutations.
401	ALK	EML4::ALK E6-E20	D	TAE684	Sensitivity/Response	In a panel of 602 cancer cell lines, 3/134 NSCLC cell lines showed <0.5% cell viability following treatment with the ALK inhibitor TAE684. Of these, NCI-H2228 harbored EML4-ALK variant 3a/b (EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20). TAE684 inhibited Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation in H2228 cells and appeared to induce a cytostatic response.
981	CDK4	EXPRESSION	D	Palbociclib	Sensitivity/Response	A preclinical study to explore the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibition with palbociclib, in a panel of sarcoma cell lines and sarcoma tumor xenografts (PDXs). The responsiveness of these cell lines correlated with their levels of CDK4 mRNA as well as in vivo PDX, but not against sarcomas displaying low levels of CDK4 and high levels of p16ink4a (CDKN2A).
982	CHEK1	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Cisplatin	Sensitivity/Response	A preclinical study to evaluate the efficacy of targeting the overexpressed CHEK1 cell cycle chekpoint kinase, including both miRNA and Prexasertib-induced inhibition. Both in vitro and in vivo, Prexasertib had strong single agent efficacy and augmented the effect of Olaparib or Cisplatin in either combination, including platinum-resistant models. CHEK1 and MYC overexpression were predictors of response.
983	CHEK1	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Olaparib	Sensitivity/Response	A preclinical study to evaluate the efficacy of targeting the overexpressed CHEK1 cell cycle chekpoint kinase, including both miRNA and Prexasertib-induced inhibition. Both in vitro and in vivo, Prexasertib had strong single agent efficacy and augmented the effect of Olaparib or Cisplatin in either combination, including platinum-resistant models. CHEK1 and MYC overexpression were predictors of response.
984	CHEK1	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Prexasertib	Sensitivity/Response	A preclinical study to evaluate the efficacy of targeting the overexpressed CHEK1 cell cycle chekpoint kinase, including both miRNA and Prexasertib-induced inhibition. Both in vitro and in vivo, Prexasertib had strong single agent efficacy and augmented the effect of Olaparib or Cisplatin in either combination, including platinum-resistant models. CHEK1 and MYC overexpression were predictors of response.
403	ALK	EML4::ALK E20-E20	D	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	EML4-ALK variants v1 (E13;A20), v2 (E20;A20), v3a (E6;A20) and v3b (E6ins33;A20) were expressed in Ba/F3 cells using retrovirus.  While all constructs rendered Ba/F3 cells IL3-independant, marked differences in sensitivity to ALK inhibitors TAE684 and crizotinib were observed, where v2 was most sensitized to growth inhibition and v3a the least, with v1 and v3b intermediate.  While phospho-ALK western blots indicated that the ALK inhibitors acted similarly on both v2 and v3a EML4-ALK variants, blots of cyclohexamide-treated cells showed that v2 had a shorter half-life than 3a in the transduced cells, potentially explaining increased v2 sensitivity.  Assays with a panel of mutated EML4-ALK variants of varied length suggested that longer EML4-ALK variants are less stable in cells, although this tendency was not observed across other types of ALK fusion.
399	ALK	EML4::ALK E6-E20	D	4-pyrimidinediamine	Sensitivity/Response	In a cohort of 75 NSCLC patients that had tested positive for 3 EML4-ALK rearrangements, two individuals were identified via RT-PCR with a novel EML4-ALK translocation involving the first 6 exons of EML4 fused to the kinase domain of ALK. Genomic PCR resolved a single breakpoint, but 2 variants of the fusion were observed in cells. Variant 3a consisted of fusion at EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20, while variant 3b fused a 33 bp intronic EML4 region between EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20.  3a and 3b showed strong in-vitro kinase activity, transformed mouse 3T3 cells, and 3b-transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors in 8/8 nude mice.  The ALK inhibitor 2,4-pyrimidinediamine inhibited growth of the 3a/b containing NCI-H2228 NSCLC cell line.  The results indicate that 3a/b is a targetable driver-mutation as other EML4-ALK variants.
422	ROS1	CD74::ROS1 G2032R	D	AZD3463	Resistance	Preclinical study analyzing the efficacy of dual ROS1/ALK and more specific ROS1 inhibitors on cell lines (Ba/F3) expressing CD74-ROS1 with and without the G2032R mutation. Selective ROS1 inhibitors retained activity against the G2032R mutation (cabozatinib, foretinib), whereas dual ALK/ROS inhibitors (crizotinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, AZD3463) or ALK-selective inhibitors (alectinib) were ineffective.
424	ROS1	CD74::ROS1 G2032R	D	Brigatinib	Resistance	Preclinical study analyzing the efficacy of dual ROS1/ALK and more specific ROS1 inhibitors on cell lines (Ba/F3) expressing CD74-ROS1 with and without the G2032R mutation. Selective ROS1 inhibitors retained activity against the G2032R mutation (cabozatinib, foretinib), whereas dual ALK/ROS inhibitors (crizotinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, AZD3463) or ALK-selective inhibitors (alectinib) were ineffective.
851	ABL1	BCR::ABL F359V	D	Axitinib	Resistance	In a proliferation assay measuring tritiated thymidine incorporation in the presence of axitinib, Ba/F3 cells carrying the BCR-ABL1 variant showed similar incorporation when harboring fusions with the F359V variant of ABL1 compared to fusions with wildtype ABL1 (IC50 of 933nM vs. 823 nM), indicating that the variant does not induce resistance.
949	KIT	K558NP	D	Regorafenib	Sensitivity/Response	In an in vitro study, an IL3 independent Ba/F3 cell line expressing KIT K558NP primary activating mutation demonstrated sensitivity to imatinib (IC50: 2nmol/L), sunitinib (IC50: 2nmol/L ), regorafenib (IC50: 4nmol/L), and ponatinib (IC50: 1nmol/L) treatments. IC50 was determined by assessing cell viability.
950	KIT	K558NP	D	Ponatinib	Sensitivity/Response	In an in vitro study, an IL3 independent Ba/F3 cell line expressing KIT K558NP primary activating mutation demonstrated sensitivity to imatinib (IC50: 2nmol/L), sunitinib (IC50: 2nmol/L ), regorafenib (IC50: 4nmol/L), and ponatinib (IC50: 1nmol/L) treatments. IC50 was determined by assessing cell viability.
436	ROS1	CD74::ROS1 G2101A	D	Foretinib	Sensitivity/Response	Ba/F3 cells expressing CD74–ROS1 G2101A showed resistance to crizotinib, compared with those expressing wild-type CD74–ROS1, and were sensitive to foretinib.
435	ROS1	CD74::ROS1 G2101A	D	Crizotinib	Resistance	Ba/F3 cells expressing CD74–ROS1 G2101A showed resistance to crizotinib, compared with those expressing wild-type CD74–ROS1, and were sensitive to foretinib.
434	ROS1	CD74::ROS1 L2026M	D	Foretinib	Sensitivity/Response	Ba/F3 cells expressing CD74–ROS1 L2026M mutation showed similar sensitivity to foretinib compared with those expressing wild-type CD74–ROS1. This is in contrast to the increased resistance to crizotinib associated with this mutation in the same assay.
423	ROS1	CD74::ROS1 G2032R	D	Crizotinib	Resistance	Preclinical study analyzing the efficacy of dual ROS1/ALK and more specific ROS1 inhibitors on cell lines (Ba/F3) expressing CD74-ROS1 with and without the G2032R mutation. Selective ROS1 inhibitors retained activity against the G2032R mutation (cabozatinib, foretinib), whereas dual ALK/ROS inhibitors (crizotinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, AZD3463) or ALK-selective inhibitors (alectinib) were ineffective.
433	ROS1	CD74::ROS1 L2026M	D	Crizotinib	Resistance	Ba/F3 cells expressing CD74–ROS1 L2026M mutation showed resistance to crizotinib (~10 fold higher IC50 value), compared with those expressing wild-type CD74–ROS1; however, showed similar sensitivity to foretinib.
431	ROS1	CD74::ROS1 L2155S	D	Crizotinib	Resistance	The L2155S mutation in ROS1 was identified in the HCC78CR1, -2 and -3 cell lines which harbor the SLC34A2–ROS1 rearrangement and in 2 patients with NSCLC with progressive disease following crizotinib treatment and CD74–ROS1 rearrangment. Crystal structure predicted ROS1 L2155S mutation to be highly destabilizating and cause protein structural modification. HCC78CR1, 2, and 3 cells and Ba/F3 cells transfected with CD74–ROS1 L2155S, showed resistance to crizotinib compared with parental HCC78 and Ba/F3 cells. In addition, these cell lines showed resistance to foretinib, a potent ROS1 inhibitor that is effective against ROS1 G2032R-mutant cells (16), and TAE684, a potent ALK inhibitor
430	ROS1	CD74::ROS1 L2155S	D	TAE684	Resistance	The L2155S mutation in ROS1 was identified in the HCC78CR1, -2 and -3 cell lines which harbor the SLC34A2–ROS1 rearrangement and in 2 patients with NSCLC with progressive disease following crizotinib treatment and CD74–ROS1 rearrangment. Crystal structure predicted ROS1 L2155S mutation to be highly destabilizating and cause protein structural modification. HCC78CR1, 2, and 3 cells and Ba/F3 cells transfected with CD74–ROS1 L2155S, showed resistance to crizotinib compared with parental HCC78 and Ba/F3 cells. In addition, these cell lines showed resistance to foretinib, a potent ROS1 inhibitor that is effective against ROS1 G2032R-mutant cells (16), and TAE684, a potent ALK inhibitor
429	ROS1	CD74::ROS1 G2032R	D	Foretinib	Sensitivity/Response	Ba/F3 cells expressing CD74–ROS1 G2032R showed resistance to crizotinib, compared with those expressing wild-type CD74–ROS1 (~128 fold higher IC50); however, showed relative sensitivity to foretinib (only ~6 fold higher IC50 than WT).
427	ROS1	CD74::ROS1 L2026M	D	Lorlatinib	Sensitivity/Response	Preclinical study of PF-06463922 in NSCLC in-vitro, in-vivo, and in enzyme assays. After establishing that the CD74-ROS1 L2026M mutation confers crizotinib resistance in kinase activity and cell viability assays (in transduced BaF3 cells), response to PF-06463922 was tested.  Wild-type CD74-ROS1, CD74-ROS1 G2032R, and CD74-ROS1 L2026M all showed sensitivity to PF-06463922 in these assays.
426	ROS1	CD74::ROS1 L2026M	D	Crizotinib	Resistance	Preclinical study of PF-06463922 in NSCLC in-vitro, in-vivo and in enzyme assays. BaF3 cells expressing CD74-ROS1 L2026M were more resistant to crizotinib treatment than wildtype CD74-ROS1 in both cell viability and ROS1 phosphorylation. Crizotinib was also less effective at inhibiting kinase activity in ROS1 with L2026M mutation than wildtype. In contrast, PF-06463922 was effectively inhibited the fusion harboring this mutation in these assays.
425	ROS1	CD74::ROS1 G2032R	D	Lorlatinib	Sensitivity/Response	Preclinical study of PF-06463922 in NSCLC in-vitro, in-vivo and in enzyme assays. PF-06463922 showed inhibition of kinase activity, cell viability and tumor growth in wild-type, G2032R and L2026M mutations in ROS1.
432	ROS1	CD74::ROS1 L2155S	D	Foretinib	Resistance	The L2155S mutation in ROS1 was identified in the HCC78CR1, -2 and -3 cell lines which harbor the SLC34A2–ROS1 rearrangement and in 2 patients with NSCLC with progressive disease following crizotinib treatment and CD74–ROS1 rearrangment. Crystal structure predicted ROS1 L2155S mutation to be highly destabilizating and cause protein structural modification. HCC78CR1, 2, and 3 cells and Ba/F3 cells transfected with CD74–ROS1 L2155S, showed resistance to crizotinib compared with parental HCC78 and Ba/F3 cells. In addition, these cell lines showed resistance to foretinib, a potent ROS1 inhibitor that is effective against ROS1 G2032R-mutant cells (16), and TAE684, a potent ALK inhibitor
398	ALK	EML4::ALK E6-E20	D	2	Sensitivity/Response	In a cohort of 75 NSCLC patients that had tested positive for 3 EML4-ALK rearrangements, two individuals were identified via RT-PCR with a novel EML4-ALK translocation involving the first 6 exons of EML4 fused to the kinase domain of ALK. Genomic PCR resolved a single breakpoint, but 2 variants of the fusion were observed in cells. Variant 3a consisted of fusion at EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20, while variant 3b fused a 33 bp intronic EML4 region between EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20.  3a and 3b showed strong in-vitro kinase activity, transformed mouse 3T3 cells, and 3b-transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors in 8/8 nude mice.  The ALK inhibitor 2,4-pyrimidinediamine inhibited growth of the 3a/b containing NCI-H2228 NSCLC cell line.  The results indicate that 3a/b is a targetable driver-mutation as other EML4-ALK variants.
383	HSPH1	NUCLEAR EXPRESSION	D	Fluorouracil	Sensitivity/Response	49 patients gastric cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy were immunohistochemically assessed for nuclear HSPH1 (HSP110) expression. Overall survival rate in the high expression group (2+ moderate/3+ strong staining) was significantly lower compared with the low expression group (0 no/1+ weak staining) (P = 0.0364). In gastric cancer cell lines (MKN7, MKN45), siRNA mediated HSP110 knockdown led to a higher sensitivity to 5-FU and cisplatin compared with the parent and control cells (p < 0.05).
991	MYC	OVEREXPRESSION	D	JQ-1	Sensitivity/Response	BET inhibition by JQ1 downregulates MYC transcription, followed by genome-wide downregulation of Myc-dependent target genes. In experimental models of multiple myeloma, a Myc-dependent hematologic malignancy, JQ1 produces a potent antiproliferative effect associated with cell-cycle arrest and cellular senescence.
347	CIP2A	UNDEREXPRESSION	D	Gemcitabine	Sensitivity/Response	Researchers studied the effect of CIP2A expression in relation to  gemcitabine sensitivity via SW1990 cell lines. SW1990 cells with CIP2A expression knocked-down displayed lower IC50 (p=.024), indicating a sensitivity to gemcitabine.
346	ALDH1A2	UNDEREXPRESSION	D	Tretinoin	Sensitivity/Response	FaDu (a high ALDH1A2 expression cell line) and Cal27 (a low expression cell line) were treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), Adapalene or Fenretinide. This led to concentration dependent decrease in the survival fraction in both cell lines with higher efficacy in Cal27 (ED50 ≈ 1 μM) as compared to FaDu cells (ED ≈ 44 μM). Treatment with 3 μM ATRA sensitized Cal27 cells to irradiation at a dose of 2 Gy, but had no or only a minor effect on ALDH1A2-postitive cells.
341	FGFR1	AMPLIFICATION	D	Afimoxifene	Resistance	FGFR1-amplified breast cancer cell lines show resistance to 4-hydroxytamoxifen, which is reversed by small interfering RNA silencing of FGFR1.
340	CEBPA	N-TERMINAL FRAME SHIFT	D	OICR-9429	Sensitivity/Response	This preclinical study establishes that the p30 isoform of CEBPA expressed as a result of N-terminal truncating mutations preferentially interacts with WRD5, a component of the SET/MLL complex. Knockdown of WRD5 in 32D cells (mouse hematopoietic cell line) or transplanted primary mouse bone marrow expressing the p30 isoform restored myeloid differentiation in these cells. OICR-9429, a small molecule inhibitor of WRD5, and anti-WRD5 siRNAs selectively inhibited colony formation of mouse fetal liver cells homozygous for N-terminal CEBPA mutations but not wildtype colony formation. Finally, OICR-9429 reduced viability of primary human AML blasts harboring N-terminal domain CEBPA mutations in culture but not AML blasts with other mutations. Taken together, WRD5 inhibition is a potential therapeutic method for patients harboring N-terminal CEBPA mutations.
339	ROS1	CD74::ROS1 G2032R	D	Cabozantinib	Sensitivity/Response	Cabozantinib was assessed in the CD74-ROS1-mutant Ba/F3 cells and crizotinib-resistant patient-derived cancer cells (MGH047) harboring G2032R-mutated CD74-ROS1. It effectively inhibited the survival of CD74-ROS1 wild-type (WT) and resistant mutants harboring Ba/F3 and MGH047 cells. Furthermore, cabozantinib could overcome all the resistance by all newly identified secondary mutations.
329	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	D	Trastuzumab Emtansine	Sensitivity/Response	Efficacy of trastuzumab in HER2 overexpressing NSCLC remains unclear.  In this study using a panel of NSCLC HER2 overexpressing cell lines, antiproliferative effects of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) were observed in a HER2-expression dependant manner, with strongest effects in Calu-3 (high expressing) and no effects in Calu-6 (low expressing).  Trastuzumab did not show notable effects on cell growth in any tested cells.  HER2 positivity in NSCLC is fairly common at 2-20%.  A clinical trial (NCT02289833) is currently underway to asses TDM-1 in HER2 overexpressing lung cancer.
357	DDX43	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Trametinib	Resistance	MEK inhibitor-resistant (selumetinib, PD0325901, GSK1129212) uveal melanoma cell lines were created from two GNAQ Q209L mutant cell lines. Overexpression of DDX43 mediated RAS-induced selumetinib resistance as demonstrated by depletion of DDX43 decreasing RAS proteins and ectopic expression of DDX43 induced RAS protein levels. These results were confirmed using biopsies from liver metastases in 14 patients with uveal melanoma harboring GNAQ or GNA11 mutations who were treated on a phase II study of selumetinib. 6 patients with partial response or stable disease for ≥16 weeks, were defined as “responders” (R), 8 patients who had disease progression before 16 weeks were defined as “nonresponders” (NR). DDX43 Expression (qPCR) was higher in nonresponders (P = 0.045). Liver metastasis biopsy samples (3 R and 3 NR) were immunoblotted for DDX43, pERK and RAS proteins with consistent results.
321	VHL	LOSS	D	Temsirolimus	Sensitivity/Response	Preclinical studies linking the efficacy of mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 to VHL loss in vitro and in mouse models of kidney cancer. VHL-deficient tumors were more sensitive to mTOR inhibition than VHL-proficient tumors. Growth arrest caused by CCI-779 correlated with a block in translation of HIF1A mRNA. Expression of a VHL-resistant HIF1A cDNA lacking the 5' untranslated region rescued tumor growth.
312	NTRK1	FUSION	D	Larotrectinib	Sensitivity/Response	Two patients were found to harbor gene fusions maintaining the kinase domain of NTRK1 (3' partner), specifically: MPRIP-NTRK1 and CD74-NTRK1.  Both of these fusions lead to constitutive kinase activity and were found to be oncogenic. Treatment of cells expressing NTRK1 fusions with inhibitors of TRKA kinase activity (ARRY-470, CEP-701 and, to a lesser extent, crizotinib) inhibited autophosphorylation of TRKA and cell growth.
311	NTRK1	FUSION	D	Lestaurtinib	Sensitivity/Response	Two patients were found to harbor gene fusions maintaining the kinase domain of NTRK1 (3' partner), specifically: MPRIP-NTRK1 and CD74-NTRK1.  Both of these fusions lead to constitutive kinase activity and were found to be oncogenic. Treatment of cells expressing NTRK1 fusions with inhibitors of TRKA kinase activity (ARRY-470, CEP-701 and, to a lesser extent, crizotinib) inhibited autophosphorylation of TRKA and cell growth.
310	EGFR	VIII	D	Nimotuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	Two human glioma cell lines (U87MG or LNZ308) overexpressing either wild-type (wt) EGFR or EGFRvIII were treated with nimotuzumab, temozolomide, or both in vitro. Anti-tumor effects of nimotuzumab were greater in EGFRvIII in comparison to EGFRwt (as measured by antitumor effects, growth suppression, survival elongation and EGFR and Akt phosphorylation). Combination of nimotuzumab and temozolomide further increased efficacy.
1033	ASS1	LOSS	D	Chloroquine	Sensitivity/Response	90% out of 700 sarcoma samples (comprising 45 histologies) demonstrated loss or reduction of argininosuccinate synthetase 1 expression. Arginine auxotrophy confers sensitivity to arginine deprivation. In sarcoma models, arginine deprivation therapy with pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20) maintains a prolonged state of arginine starvation without causing cell death. Combination of ADI-PEG20 and chloroquine led to synergistic cell death via necroptosis and apoptosis.
1034	ASS1	LOSS	D	Pegargiminase	Sensitivity/Response	90% out of 700 sarcoma samples (comprising 45 histologies) demonstrated loss or reduction of argininosuccinate synthetase 1 expression. Arginine auxotrophy confers sensitivity to arginine deprivation. In sarcoma models, arginine deprivation therapy with pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20) maintains a prolonged state of arginine starvation without causing cell death. Combination of ADI-PEG20 and chloroquine led to synergistic cell death via necroptosis and apoptosis.
1035	ASS1	LOSS	D	Platinum Compound	Resistance	Preclinical evidence for epigenetic inactivation of ASS1 as a determinant of response to platinum chemotherapy suggesting that silencing of ASS1 contributes to treatment failure and clinical relapse in ovarian cancer.
313	NTRK1	FUSION	D	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	Two patients were found to harbor gene fusions maintaining the kinase domain of NTRK1 (3' partner), specifically: MPRIP-NTRK1 and CD74-NTRK1.  Both of these fusions lead to constitutive kinase activity and were found to be oncogenic. Treatment of cells expressing NTRK1 fusions with inhibitors of TRKA kinase activity (ARRY-470, CEP-701 and, to a lesser extent, crizotinib) inhibited autophosphorylation of TRKA and cell growth.
1010	BARD1	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	D	Olaparib	Sensitivity/Response	Loss of BARD1 function through the expression of a BARD1 splice variant, BARD1β, results in a more malignant phenotype with decreased RAD51 foci formation, reduced BRCA1 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and decreased nuclear BRCA1 protein localization. BARD1β sensitizes colon cancer cells to poly ADP ribose polymerase 1 (PARP-1) inhibition even in a BRCA1 WT background.
1009	BAP1	ALTERNATIVE TRANSCRIPT (ATI)	D	Apitolisib	Sensitivity/Response	A novel alternative splice isoform of BAP1 (BAP1Δ) that misses part of the catalytic domain showed reduced deubiquitinating activity compared with full-length BAP1. 4 MPM cell lines expressing more than 20% of BAP1Δ were more sensitive to olaparib (a PARP1 inhibitor) than 4 cell lines with less BAP1Δ expression, and this sensitivity was enhanced when olaparib treatment was combined with GDC0980 (a dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor).

382	HSPH1	NUCLEAR EXPRESSION	D	Cisplatin	Sensitivity/Response	49 patients gastric cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy were immunohistochemically assessed for nuclear HSPH1 (HSP110) expression. Overall survival rate in the high expression group (2+ moderate/3+ strong staining) was significantly lower compared with the low expression group (0 no/1+ weak staining) (P = 0.0364). In gastric cancer cell lines (MKN7, MKN45), siRNA mediated HSP110 knockdown led to a higher sensitivity to 5-FU and cisplatin compared with the parent and control cells (p < 0.05).
375	ERBB3	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Selumetinib	Resistance	Preclinical study in KRAS mutant lung and colon cancer models. A synthetic lethal screen identified ERBB3 blockade to confer sensitivity to MEK inhibitors. The dual EGFR-ERBB2 (both forming heterodimers with ERBB3) inhibitors afatinib and dacomitinib each showed strong synergy with MEK Inhibition (trametinib or selumetinib) in several KRAS mutant cell lines. MEK Inhibitors alone or the combination with gefitinib (EGFRi) or CP724714 (ERBB2i) showed strong synergy. Results were validated in-vivo. Basal ERBB3 expression was associated with higher synergy scores.

372	ERBB3	OVEREXPRESSION	D	HER2 Inhibitor CP-724	Resistance	Preclinical study in KRAS mutant lung and colon cancer models. A synthetic lethal screen identified ERBB3 blockade to confer sensitivity to MEK inhibitors. The dual EGFR-ERBB2 (both forming heterodimers with ERBB3) inhibitors afatinib and dacomitinib each showed strong synergy with MEK Inhibition (trametinib or selumetinib) in several KRAS mutant cell lines.

Basal ERBB3 expression was associated with higher synergy scores.
371	ERBB3	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Selumetinib	Sensitivity/Response	Preclinical study in KRAS mutant lung and colon cancer models. A synthetic lethal screen using a total of 3,530 shRNAs to target 518 human kinases identified ERBB3 knockdown to confer sensitivity of selumetinib-resistant H358 cells (NSCLC cell line) to the MEK inhibitor selumetinib. The dual EGFR-ERBB2 inhibitors afatinib and dacomitinib each showed synergy with MEK Inhibition via selumetinib in 4 KRAS mutant cell lines. Western blot evaluation of 9 NSCLC and 12 CRC cell lines showed ERBB3 expression correlated with the synergy score for combination afatinib and trametinib treatment. I.e. the synergy score was low in cells having low basal levels of ERBB3 protein and high for cells having high basal ERBB3 expression. Using selumetinib in patient-derived CRC xenografts or trametinib in NSCLC xenografts, MEK inhibition by selumetinib or trametinib in combination with afatinib more effectively inhibited increases in tumor volume than either monotherapy.

369	HAVCR2	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Anti-TIM-3 Monoclonal Antibody	Sensitivity/Response	In a preclinical study in an immunocompetent mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, upregulation of alternative immune checkpoints, notably T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3, aka HAVCR2) was observed after progression under PD-1 antibody. A survival advantage was observed with the addition of a TIM-3 blocking antibody.
368	HAVCR2	OVEREXPRESSION	D	PD1 Inhibitor	Sensitivity/Response	In a preclinical study in an immunocompetent mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, upregulation of alternative immune checkpoints, notably T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3, aka HAVCR2) was observed after progression under PD-1 antibody. A survival advantage was observed with the addition of a TIM-3 blocking antibody.
364	STK11	LOSS	D	Docetaxel	Resistance	A clinical trial comparing selumetinib and docetaxel vs. docetaxel and placebo in KRAS mutant NSCLC was recapitulated in mice. Tumors were induced in lung epithelium by nasal instillation of CRE-bearing adenovirus in conditionally targeted mice. Kras(G12D) and Lkb1 (STK11) knockout mutant mice showed only mild response to combined treatment and very low response rates to docetaxel monotherapy compared to mice with Kras(G12D) alone or Kras(G12D) and Trp53 knockout. In a small number of human NSCLC patients with these genotypes FDG-PET signal intensity changes and pERK IHC staining correlated with mouse data.

Tumors were induced in lung epithelium by nasal instillation of CRE-bearing adenovirus in conditionally targeted mice. Kras(G12D) and Lkb1 (STK11) knockout mutant mice showed only mild response to combined treatment and very low response rates to docetaxel monotherapy compared to mice with Kras(G12D) alone or Kras(G12D) and Trp53 knockout. In a small number of human NSCLC patients with these genotypes FDG-PET signal intensity changes and pERK IHC staining correlated with mouse data.
362	TBK1	OVEREXPRESSION	D	AZ909	Sensitivity/Response	Preclinical study in melanoma cell lines. TBK1 depletion (siRNA) inhibited migration and invasion, whereas its constitutive overexpression led to an increase in invasion. In MEK-resistant NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines, TBK1 depletion or inhibition (AZ909) in combination with MEK inhibitors (selumetinib) promoted apoptosis in 3D culture.
361	TBK1	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Selumetinib	Sensitivity/Response	Preclinical study in melanoma cell lines. TBK1 depletion (siRNA) inhibited migration and invasion, whereas its constitutive overexpression led to an increase in invasion. In MEK-resistant NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines, TBK1 depletion or inhibition (AZ909) in combination with MEK inhibitors (selumetinib) promoted apoptosis in 3D culture.
359	DDX43	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Selumetinib	Resistance	MEK inhibitor-resistant (selumetinib, PD0325901, GSK1129212) uveal melanoma cell lines were created from two GNAQ Q209L mutant cell lines. Overexpression of DDX43 mediated RAS-induced selumetinib resistance as demonstrated by depletion of DDX43 decreasing RAS proteins and ectopic expression of DDX43 induced RAS protein levels. These results were confirmed using biopsies from liver metastases in 14 patients with uveal melanoma harboring GNAQ or GNA11 mutations who were treated on a phase II study of selumetinib. 6 patients with partial response or stable disease for ≥16 weeks, were defined as “responders” (R), 8 patients who had disease progression before 16 weeks were defined as “nonresponders” (NR). DDX43 Expression (qPCR) was higher in nonresponders (P = 0.045). Liver metastasis biopsy samples (3 R and 3 NR) were immunoblotted for DDX43, pERK and RAS proteins with consistent results.
675	CDKN2A	LOSS	D	Linsitinib	Sensitivity/Response	A patient-derived xenograft (PDX) from a patient with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B (CDKN2A/B) loss and FUS-ERG fusion positive Ewing's sarcoma was created. The PDX was treated in four cohorts (each N=6) with control, doxorubicin, CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib or IGF-1R inhibitor linsitinib. Both linsitinib and palbociclib cohorts were significantly more effective than control and doxorubicin. Doxorubicin was part of the patient's treatment (Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with DOX, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide) and was noted by authors as failing to control tumor growth.
947	KIT	K558NP	D	Imatinib	Sensitivity/Response	In an in vitro study, an IL3 independent Ba/F3 cell line expressing KIT K558NP primary activating mutation demonstrated sensitivity to imatinib (IC50: 2nmol/L), sunitinib (IC50: 2nmol/L ), regorafenib (IC50: 4nmol/L), and ponatinib (IC50: 1nmol/L) treatments. IC50 was determined by assessing cell viability.
439	BRAF	DEL 485-490	D	Pan-RAF Inhibitor LY3009120	Sensitivity/Response	Cells harboring in-frame deletions in BRAF in the L485-P490 amino acid region were found to be sensitive to the RAF dimer inhibitor LY3009120, but not sensitive to the BRAF-selective inhibitors vemurafenib or dabrafenib. These deletions were observed in KRAS wildtype pancreatic, ovarian, NSCLC, and thyroid cancers. In three cell lines H2405 (NSCLC with L485-P490>Y), BxPC-3 (pancreatic with V487-P492>A), and OV-90 (ovarian with N486-P490del), BRAF deletion–mediated MAPK activation was found to be sensitive to LY3009120 as evidenced by dose-dependent inhibition of phospho-MEK and ERK and cell growth inhibition with IC50 values of 0.04, 0.087, and 0.007 μmol/L in these three cell lines. LY3009120, but not vemurafenib, also inhibited tumor growth of both H2405 and BxPC-3 cells xenografted into mice.
948	KIT	K558NP	D	Sunitinib	Sensitivity/Response	In an in vitro study, an IL3 independent Ba/F3 cell line expressing KIT K558NP primary activating mutation demonstrated sensitivity to imatinib (IC50: 2nmol/L), sunitinib (IC50: 2nmol/L ), regorafenib (IC50: 4nmol/L), and ponatinib (IC50: 1nmol/L) treatments. IC50 was determined by assessing cell viability.
448	ALK	ALK FUSION I1171	D	TAE684	Sensitivity/Response	The I1171T ALK kinase domain mutaion was found in the MGH056-1 cell line which was derived from an ALK rearranged NSCLC patient who had progressed on crizotinib and then on alectinib given at lower dose (300mg twice daily).  Ectopic expression of EML4-ALK I1171T in Ba/F3 cells made these cells moderately resistant to crizotinib and resistant to alectinib. In contrast, the frequently used tool compound TAE684 was equally effective against EML4-ALK wild-type and I1171T, causing cell death at 1000x lower concentration then in unaltered Ba/F3 cells supplemented with IL3.
497	CDKN2A	LOSS	D	Alvocidib	Sensitivity/Response	Preclinical study in 9 melanoma cell lines. Three cell lines did not have CDKN2A (p16) mutations and showed expression of the protein on western blot analysis. Two of the other six cell lines had stop codons leading to a truncated protein, and three had missense mutations with evidence of protein expression on western blot (two cell lines with a P114L mutation and one with an E88K mutation). Mean IC50s of flavopiridol were significantly lower in cell lines with a mutated or non-expressed p16 (p16-) (mean 50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] = 12.5 nM), than in cell lines with intact p16 (p16+) (mean IC(50) = 25 nM).
492	ALK	ALK FUSION G1269A	D	Ceritinib	Sensitivity/Response	EML4-ALK with G1269A mutation was tested for sensitivity to ceritinib via transduction into Ba/F3 cells and generation of survival curves varying ceritinib concentration. IC50 of 33 nM was seen, which was 1.5 times the IC50 for EML4-ALK wild-type, indicating sensitivity of the G1269A mutation to ceritinib in the context of EML4-ALK. The mutation was also tested for ceritinib sensitivity in the context of NPM-ALK, where IC50 values were reported of 19 nM and 20 nM for mutant and wild-type versions, respectively, also indicating sensitivity. In western blots,  Y1604 pALK levels for wild-type NPM-ALK were ablated at 100 nM, while at 100 nM residual pALK levels were seen in G1269A blotting, with ablation of signal at and above 300 nM, which differed somewhat from the equivalent IC50 values reported for mutant and wild-type in the NPM-ALK background, but still agrees with sensitivity to ceritinib for this mutation.
491	ALK	ALK FUSION G1269A	D	Alectinib	Resistance	EML4-ALK with ALK G1269A mutation was tested for sensitivity to alectinib using Ba/F3 cells. In Ba/F3 cells with ectopic EML4-ALK variant 1 G1269A, IC50 of 84 nM was reported with alectinib, which was a 6 fold increase over IC50 for EML4-ALK wild-type. The authors considered a fold difference of 4 to 10 between the alectinib-sensitized wild-type and mutant variant to indicate a resistant mutant variant. In the background of the NPM-ALK fusion, IC50 for G1269A mutation was 104 nM, which was 5.3 fold that reported for NPM-ALK wild-type. Western blots of alectinib treated NPM-ALK G1269A were performed and reduced pALK Y1604 was seen at 300 nM alectinib, and no pALK at 1000 nM. In contrast pALK signal was ablated at and above 100 nM in NPM-ALK wild-type.
490	ALK	ALK FUSION G1269A	D	Brigatinib	Sensitivity/Response	EML4-ALK with ALK G1269A has been seen in crizotinib resistant NSCLC, and this mutation was tested for Brigatinib sensitivity via ectopic expression in Ba/F3 cells, where half maximal inhibitory concentration of 9 nM was seen, which was 1.5 times the IC50 of EML4-ALK wild-type to brigatinib. NPM-ALK G1269A was also tested for brigatinib sensitivity, and IC50 values of 11 nM were reported for both NPM-ALK G1269A and NPM-ALK wild-type. In western blotting, brigatinib at and above 100 nM ablated pALK signal (Y 1604), indicating sensitivity of this variant to brigatinib together with the other results.
892	ABL1	BCR::ABL F317L	D	Axitinib	Resistance	In a proliferation assay measuring tritiated thymidine incorporation in the presence of axitinib, Ba/F3 cells carrying the BCR-ABL1 variant showed increased incorporation when harboring fusions with the F317L variant of ABL1 compared to fusions with wildtype ABL1 (IC50 of 1220nM vs. 823 nM), indicating resistance.
489	ALK	ALK FUSION G1202R	D	Tanespimycin	Sensitivity/Response	The G1202R ALK mutation was found in a crizotinib-resistant ALK-rearranged NSCLC, and the mutant ALK fusion was further characterized in Ba/F3 cells. EML4-ALK variant 1 with G1202R mutation was expressed in Ba/F3 and subject to 17-AAG. IC50 for cell number in response to 17-AAG was 33.4 nM, in contrast to IC50 for EML4-ALK wild-type, which was 98.9 nM, suggesting sensitization of this variant to HSP90 inhibition.
488	ALK	ALK FUSION G1202R	D	Brigatinib	Resistance	This study compared drug responses in Ba/F3 cells expressing either EML4-ALK or NPM-ALK fusions, with or without G1202R ALK mutation. Cells expressing the EML4-ALK variant 3 with G1202R ALK mutation were more resistant to brigatinib treatment (IC50 325 nM) than cells expressing wildtype EML4-ALK variant 3 (IC50 6 nM). These same experiments performed with the NPM-ALK fusion resulted in IC50 of 149 nM for G1202R and 11nM for wild type, consistent with resistance. In Western blots, ablation of pALK with brigatinib treatment above 100 nM was seen in Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK wildtype, but remained apparent at 1000 nM brigatinib in NPM-ALK G1202R cells, despite dose-dependent reduction.
487	ALK	ALK FUSION G1202R	D	Alectinib	Resistance	Ba/F3 cell line expressing EML4-ALK variant 3 with G1202R ALK mutation was assessed for alectinib sensitivity and IC50 for survival of 868 nM was reported, which was 64.4x higher than the IC50 reported for alectinib on Ba/F3 with EML4-ALK wild-type. Similar experiments using NPM-ALK instead of EML4-ALK yielded survival IC50 of 549 nM of NPM-ALK G1202R to alectinib, which was 27.9 times higher than IC50 for NPM-ALK wild-type. Western blots of Ba/F3 with NPM-ALK wild-type showed ablation of pALK levels above 100 nM alectinib, while pALK levels were essentially unchanged up to 1000 nM in NPM-ALK G1202R Ba/F3 cells.
486	ALK	EML4::ALK T1151INST	D	Tanespimycin	Sensitivity/Response	Ba/F3 cells transduced with EML4-ALK 1151 insT were treated with 17-AAG producing an IC50 value of 44.5 nM, which was 0.4 times that reported for EML4-ALK wildtype in Ba/F3, indicating possible increased dependence of EML4-ALK 1151 insT on HSP90. 17-AAG also reduced survival of the parental IL3-dependent Ba/F3 cells (183.7 nM), indicating increased nonspecific effects of 17_AAG treatment. Crizotinib resistant clones were produced from the parental EML4-ALK variant 1 containing cell line H3122 (CR1, CR2, CR3). H3122 CR2 was found to contain the EML4-ALK InsT variant. H3122 CR2 and H3122 cells were similarly sensitized to 17-AAG death with an IC50 value of approximately 5 nM, while control cells without EML4-ALK had IC50 values approximately 10x higher.
485	ALK	EML4::ALK T1151INST	D	TAE684	Resistance	Treatment of Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK 1151 insT with TAE684 produced an IC50 value (28.3 nM) 20x higher cells expressing EML4-ALK wildtype variant 1. The crizotinib resistant clones were produced from parental H3122 cells (CR1, CR2, CR3). H3122 CR2 was found to contain the 1151 Tins variant as well as elevated EML4-ALK expression. H3122 CR2 cells treated with TAE684 produced IC50 values 20-30 times that of the parental H3122 cells. These results suggest possible variant resistance to the TAE684-derived compound ceritinib.
484	ALK	EML4::ALK T1151INST	D	Alectinib	Resistance	Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK with 1151 Tins treated with alectinib had an IC50 of 165.7 nM, 16x higher than those expressing EML4-ALK wildtype variant 1. EML4-ALK variant 1 expressing H3122 NSCLC cell line was cultured in increasing levels of crizotinib to produce crizotinib resistant cell lines CR1, CR2 and CR3. H3122 CR2 was found to contain an 1151 insT ALK mutation and increased EML4-ALK levels. The H3122 CR2 cell line survival IC50 value for alectinib treatment was approximately 20x higher than that for H3122 cells.
483	ALK	EML4::ALK C1156Y	D	Crizotinib	Resistance	EML4-ALK variant 3 containing NSCLC cell line H2228 xenografts in SCID beige mice were treated with increasing doses of crizotinib up to 100 mg/kg per day by oral gavage. At approximately 40 days tumors progressed. 80 progressed tumors were tested for ALK mutations, and 6 mutant ALK variants were found. Two of the mutations were at ALK C1156Y. In Ba/F3 cells, EML4-ALK variant 3 with C1156Y was introduced and tested for crizotinib sensitivity. Survival IC50 value of 177 nM was reported, which is 9.3 times the IC50 reported for crizotinib in EML4-ALK wild-type Ba/F3 cells.
482	ALK	ALK FUSION G1202R	D	Ceritinib	Resistance	Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK variant 1 with ALK G1202R mutation were assessed for ceritinib sensitivity. Crizotinib was shown to confer significantly more potency than ceritinib (43-fold decrease in IC50). EML4-ALK variant 3 NSCLC cell line H2228 was used in SCID mouse xenografts which were exposed to increasing crizotinib up to 100 mg/kg. Within 40 days tumors progressed, and progressed tumors were assayed for ALK mutation. Of 80 tumors, 6 had ALK mutation and 3 of these were G1202R. Treatment of crizotinib progressed tumors with ceritinib resulted in tumor growth which did not differ appreciably from crizotinib or vehicle treatment of these tumors.
481	ALK	ALK FUSION I1171	D	Ceritinib	Sensitivity/Response	Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK variant 3 with ALK I1171T mutation were treated with ceritinib, and survival IC50 of 2.6 nM was observed, which compares favorably with highly ceritinib sensitive EML4-ALK wild-type variant 1 survival IC50 of 1.7 nM reported from parallel experiments. Tumors from mice with EML4-ALK variant 3 H2228 NSCLC cell xenografts which had progressed after approximately 40 days of crizotinib treatment were sequenced for ALK mutations. I1171T was found as one of 6 ALK resistance mutations from 80 sequenced tumors. Treatment of these mouse xenograft models with ceritinib reduced tumor volume to zero, while in contrast tumor size increased with crizotinib treatment.
480	ALK	EML4::ALK S1206Y	D	Ceritinib	Sensitivity/Response	Ba/F3 cells expressing the EML4-ALK S1206Y variant were treated with ceritinib, and survival GI50 value of 1.5 nM was obtained, which compares favorably with GI50 of 1.7 for the highly ceritinib sensitive EML4-ALK wild-type variant obtained in parallel experiments, as well as the GI50 value of 16 nM obtained for crizotinib treatment of EML4-ALK wild-type.
498	CDKN2A	LOSS	D	Palbociclib	Sensitivity/Response	Preclinical study of CDK4/6 inhibitor PD-0332991 in 28 renal carcinoma cell lines (25 malignant RCC and three non-malignant, transformed cell lines derived from kidney epithelium). Both p15 and p16 loss (CGH) were tested for association with response to PD-0332991 using Fisher's exact test. Cell lines with p16 and p15 losses were significantly more likely to be classified as responders (defined by pharmacokinetic data-based concentration of <=400nM) to PD-0332991 (p=0.027, relative risk (RR)=2.06 and p=0.047, RR=1.71, respectively). Four cell lines had homozygous deletions of CDKN2A but not CDKN2B, and three of these lines were classified as being sensitive to PD-0332991. There were no cell lines with only CDKN2B deletion.
883	ABL1	BCR::ABL D276G	D	Axitinib	Resistance	In a proliferation assay measuring tritiated thymidine incorporation in the presence of axitinib, Ba/F3 cells carrying the BCR-ABL1 variant showed increased incorporations when harboring fusions with the D276G variant of ABL1 compared to fusions with wildtype ABL1 (IC50 of 1105nM vs. 823 nM), indicating resistance.
499	CDKN2B	LOSS	D	Palbociclib	Sensitivity/Response	Preclinical study of CDK4/6 inhibitor PD-0332991 in 28 renal carcinoma cell lines (25 malignant RCC and three non-malignant, transformed cell lines derived from kidney epithelium). Both p15 and p16 loss (CGH) were tested for association with response to PD-0332991 using Fisher's exact test. Cell lines with p16 and p15 losses were significantly more likely to be classified as responders (defined by pharmacokinetic data-based concentration of <=400nM) to PD-0332991 (p=0.027, relative risk (RR)=2.06 and p=0.047, RR=1.71, respectively). Four cell lines had homozygous deletions of CDKN2A but not CDKN2B, and three of these lines were classified as being sensitive to PD-0332991. There were no cell lines with only CDKN2B deletion.
500	CDKN2A	LOSS	D	Palbociclib	Sensitivity/Response	In a cohort of 143 patients with primary invasive melanoma hemizygous or homozygous loss of CDKN2A was observed (FISH) in 56% of cases. PD0332991 efficacy (proliferation assay) was assessed in a panel of 47 melanoma cell lines. Loss of functional p16INK4A (CDKN2A) due to gene deletion (49% of cells), methylation (4% of cells), or mutation (19% of cells) was the most prevalent alteration occurring in 71% of cell lines, and significantly correlated with PD0332991 sensitivity (Fisher's exact test P < 0.02).
531	PTEN	LOSS	D	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	Knockdown of PTEN in trastuzumab sensitive HER2 breast cancer BT474 cells induced trastuzumab resistance. PTEN null cells treated with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 also did not show substantial inhibition, but co-treatment with trastuzumab and LY294002 induced growth inhibition comparable to trastuzumab alone in normal BT474 cells. BT474 mouse xenograft tumors were injected with PTEN antisense (AS) oligonucleotides and this resulted in trastuzumab resitance. Co-treatment of PTEN AS tumor mice with LY294002 and trastuzumab inhibited tumor growth in comparison to PTEN AS tumors treated with trastuzumab or LY294002 alone.
530	PTEN	LOSS	D	PI3K/BET Inhibitor LY294002	Sensitivity/Response	Knockdown of PTEN in trastuzumab sensitive HER2 breast cancer BT474 cells induced trastuzumab resistance. PTEN null cells treated with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 also did not show substantial inhibition, but co-treatment with trastuzumab and LY294002 induced growth inhibition comparable to trastuzumab alone in normal BT474 cells. BT474 mouse xenograft tumors were injected with PTEN antisense (AS) oligonucleotides and this resulted in trastuzumab resitance. Co-treatment of PTEN AS tumor mice with LY294002 and trastuzumab inhibited tumor growth in comparison to PTEN AS tumors treated with trastuzumab or LY294002 alone.
528	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	D	Trastuzumab	Sensitivity/Response	In 5 trastuzumab resistant HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cell lines, combination of the pan-PI3K inhibitor XL147 (pilaralisib) and trastuzumab treatment induced cell death to similar or greater levels than XL147 alone. In three trastuzumab resistant cell lines tested, colony formation in matrigel was markedly inhibited by combination treatment. Apoptotic markers were apparent with combination treatment. In athymic mice, trastuzumab resistant cell line HR6 was used in tumor xenografts and tumors were allowed to form. Mice subsequently treated with trastuzumab or XL147 showed continued tumor growth without marked difference from control, while combination treatment essentially halted tumor growth rate.

859	ABL1	BCR::ABL L248V	D	Axitinib	Resistance	In a proliferation assay measuring tritiated thymidine incorporation in the presence of axitinib, Ba/F3 cells carrying the BCR-ABL1 variant showed decreased incorporation when harboring fusions with the L248V variant of ABL1 compared to fusions with wildtype ABL1 (IC50 of 1393nM vs. 823 nM), indicating resistance.
864	ABL1	BCR::ABL G250E	D	Axitinib	Resistance	In a proliferation assay measuring tritiated thymidine incorporation in the presence of axitinib, Ba/F3 cells carrying the BCR-ABL1 variant showed higher incorporation when harboring fusions with the G250E variant of ABL1 compared to fusions with wildtype ABL1 (IC50 of 1295nM vs. 823 nM), indicating resistance.
865	ABL1	BCR::ABL Q252H	D	Axitinib	Resistance	In a proliferation assay measuring tritiated thymidine incorporation in the presence of axitinib, Ba/F3 cells carrying the BCR-ABL1 variant showed increased incorporation when harboring fusions with the Q252H variant of ABL1 compared to fusions with wildtype ABL1 (IC50 of 1155nM vs. 823 nM), indicating resistance.
941	ABL1	BCR::ABL G398R	D	Dasatinib	Sensitivity/Response	In an in vitro study, a Ba/F3  cell line stably expressing the G398R mutation in the ABL1 portion of the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein was associated with sensitivity to dasatinib treatment (IC50: 1.27nM vs. IC50: 1.83nM), comparable to Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL1 fusion protein. Sensitivity was determined by assessing cell proliferation.
867	ABL1	BCR::ABL Y253H	D	Axitinib	Resistance	In a proliferation assay measuring tritiated thymidine incorporation in the presence of axitinib, Ba/F3 cells carrying the BCR-ABL1 variant showed similar incorporation when harboring fusions with the Y253H variant of ABL1 compared to fusions with wildtype ABL1 (IC50 of 867nM vs. 823 nM), indicating that the variant does not induce resistance.
874	ABL1	BCR::ABL Y253F	D	Axitinib	Resistance	In a proliferation assay measuring tritiated thymidine incorporation in the presence of axitinib, Ba/F3 cells carrying the BCR-ABL1 variant showed increased incorporation when harboring fusions with the Y253F variant of ABL1 compared to fusions with wildtype ABL1 (IC50 of 1275nM vs. 823 nM), indicating resistance.
505	PTEN	LOSS	D	Trastuzumab	Resistance	A large-scale RNAi genetic sereen in HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cell line BT-474 was performed to discover genes whose loss induced trastuzumab resistance. The most prominently enriched gene in trastuzumab resistant populations was PTEN. Subsequent knockdown of PTEN in BT-474 cells increased cell survival when treated with trastuzumab, and growth curves showed partial restoration of proliferation in PTEN knockdown BT-474 cells treated with trastuzumab.
504	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	D	Tgx 221	Sensitivity/Response	Treatment of cells obtained from MMTV-NeuT mouse mammary tumors with the p110beta selective inhibitor TGX-221 showed significant but minimal reductions in lipid kinase activity and negligible reductions in phospho Akt levels. In simmilar cells subjected to p110alpha isoform knockout, TGX-221 treatment fully blocked Akt activation, indicating that TGX-221 was fully inhibiting the p110beta isoform. Athymic mice recieved MMTV-NeuT tumor cell transplants and were treated with TGX-221, which resulted in significant but minimal reduction in tumor growth compared to controls.
503	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	D	A66	Sensitivity/Response	Pharmacologic (A66; p110alpha specific inhibitor) or genetic (cre-mediated knockout) ablation of the p110alpha PI3K isoform reduced tumor growth and tumor formation, respectively, in athymic mice transplanted with cells transduced by MMTV-NeuT (mammary specific overexpression of HER2 that effectively induces tumors). A66 treatment of cells from MMTV-NeuT mouse tumors resulted in decreased lipid kinase activity and phospho Akt levels.
502	ERBB2	AMPLIFICATION	D	Pictilisib	Sensitivity/Response	The HER2/Neu mammary tumor mouse model MMTV-NeuT was employed to demonstrate dependence of HER2 tumor formation on PIK3 p110alpha isoform. MMTV-NeuT mice were crossed with floxed p110alpha mice. Diassacociated tumors cells from these mice were treated with Cre adenovirus to delete p110alpha, or GFP adenovirus, and cells were transplanted into athymic mice. GFP treated cells formed new tumors, while p110alpha deletion blocked tumor formation indicating tumor dependence on PI3KA. Next, MMTV-NeuT tumors were dissociated and treated with pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941. Reduced lipid kinase activity and reduced phospho-Akt levels were seen in these cells. Administration of 125 mg/kg GDC-0941 to athymic mice with transplantation of tumor cells caused marked reduction of tumor cell volume in comparison to control treatment.
501	CDKN2A	LOSS	D	Palbociclib	Sensitivity/Response	Preclinical study of the effects of PD-0332991 on proliferation, cell-cycle, apoptosis, and Rb phosphorylation in a panel of 40 human ovarian cancer cell lines. Concentration-dependent antiproliferative effects of PD-0332991 were seen in all ovarian cancer cell lines, but varied significantly between individual lines. Rb-proficient cell lines with low p16 expression were significantly more sensitive to PD-0332991 (as defined by IC50 < mean) in mRNA expression (Agilent), protein level (Western Blot) and copy number (Array CGH) analyses.
880	ABL1	BCR::ABL E255K	D	Axitinib	Resistance	In a proliferation assay measuring tritiated thymidine incorporation in the presence of axitinib, Ba/F3 cells carrying the BCR-ABL1 variant showed increased incorporation when harboring fusions with the E255K variant of ABL1 compared to fusions with wildtype ABL1 (IC50 of 1282nM vs. 823 nM), indicating resistance.
513	PIK3CA	AMPLIFICATION	D	Alpelisib	Sensitivity/Response	474 cancer cell lines from the cancer cell line encyclopedia were assessed for response to the PI3Kalpha inhibitor BYL719 (Alpelisib). PIK3CA amplification was significanly associated with BYL719 response. A gastric cancer patient derived xenograft (PDX) was transplanted into two athymic mice and one was treated with BYL719. The untreated PDX grew by over 100 percent while the BYL719 tumor was reduced by 86 percent.
479	ALK	ALK FUSION G1269A	D	Ceritinib	Sensitivity/Response	The NSCLC cell line MGH021-4, harboring SQSTM1-ALK G1269A, was 6 times more sensitive to ceritinib (80nM GI50) than crizotinib (500 nM) in proliferation assays and caused notable reductions in phospho-ALK and phospho-AKT (detected by Western blot) at concentrations 10 fold lower than crizotinib. GI50 values were similar in Ba/F3 cells expressing either EML4-ALK wild-type or EML4-ALK G1269A (1.6nM and 2.2nM, respectively). In contrast, crizotinib treatment of Ba/F3 with EML4-ALK G1269A had survival GI50 of 130nM.
358	DDX43	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Mirdametinib	Resistance	MEK inhibitor-resistant (selumetinib, PD0325901, GSK1129212) uveal melanoma cell lines were created from two GNAQ Q209L mutant cell lines. Overexpression of DDX43 mediated RAS-induced selumetinib resistance as demonstrated by depletion of DDX43 decreasing RAS proteins and ectopic expression of DDX43 induced RAS protein levels. These results were confirmed using biopsies from liver metastases in 14 patients with uveal melanoma harboring GNAQ or GNA11 mutations who were treated on a phase II study of selumetinib. 6 patients with partial response or stable disease for ≥16 weeks, were defined as “responders” (R), 8 patients who had disease progression before 16 weeks were defined as “nonresponders” (NR). DDX43 Expression (qPCR) was higher in nonresponders (P = 0.045). Liver metastasis biopsy samples (3 R and 3 NR) were immunoblotted for DDX43, pERK and RAS proteins with consistent results.
477	ALK	EML4::ALK E6-E20	D	Ceritinib	Sensitivity/Response	Ceritinib was 28x more potent (GI50 3.8nM) than crizotinib (GI50 107nM) at inhibiting growth of  H2228, an NSCLC cell line which harbors the EML4-ALK variant 3a/3b. SCID mice xenografted with H2228 were treated for 14 days with crizotinib (100 mg/kg) or ceritinib (25 or 50 mg/kg). All treatments caused tumor regression, but tumors recurred within 11 days after crizotinib treatment withdrawal. 4/8 mice treated with 25 mg/kg ceritinib showed regrowth after 1 month treatment withdrawal. The remaining 4/8 mice treated at 25 mg/kg ceritinib, and all mice treated at 50 mg/kg ceritinib maintained complete remission for four months. While 100 mg/kg crizotinib in mice approximates levels 3-5 times the maximal tolerated dose in humans, the authors state 25 to 50 mg/kg ceritinib in mice is predicted to approximate tolerable doses in humans.
478	ALK	EML4::ALK L1196M	D	Ceritinib	Sensitivity/Response	The crizotinib-resistant MGH045 cell line with EML4-ALK L1196M was treated with crizotinib or ceritinib. In nude mice with MGH045 xenografts, tumor response to crizotinib did not differ appreciably from vehicle, while ceritinib controlled tumor growth. Ceritinib inhibited Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK L1196M slightly stronger than ALK wild-type, but approximately double the potency as crizotinib, indicating ceritinib sensitivity in Ba/F3 EML4-ALK L1196M cells.
924	ABL1	BCR::ABL F359I	D	Axitinib	Resistance	In a proliferation assay measuring tritiated thymidine incorporation in the presence of axitinib, Ba/F3 cells carrying the BCR-ABL1 variant showed similar incorporation when harboring fusions with the F359I variant of ABL1 compared to fusions with wildtype ABL1 (IC50 of 975nM vs. 823 nM), indicating that the variant does not induce resistance.
462	FANCC	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	D	Mitomycin	Sensitivity/Response	In the pancreatic cell lines PL11 (FANCC homozygous deletion) and Hs766T (FANCG-mutated), sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents was observed. PL11 cells (empty vector transduced) were more sensitive to mitomycin C (MMC), cisplatin, chlorambucil, and melphalan than PL11 cells transduced with a vector wildtype FANCC. Similarly, mouse xenografts of PL11 cells (empty vector) were more sensitive to MMC or gemcitabine than PL11 cells expressing a wildtype FANCC.
461	FANCC	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	D	Cisplatin	Sensitivity/Response	In the pancreatic cell lines PL11 (FANCC homozygous deletion) and Hs766T (FANCG-mutated), sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents was observed. PL11 cells (empty vector transduced) were more sensitive to mitomycin C (MMC), cisplatin, chlorambucil, and melphalan than PL11 cells transduced with a vector wildtype FANCC. Similarly, mouse xenografts of PL11 cells (empty vector) were more sensitive to MMC or gemcitabine than PL11 cells expressing a wildtype FANCC.
460	FANCC	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	D	Chlorambucil	Sensitivity/Response	In the pancreatic cell lines PL11 (FANCC homozygous deletion) and Hs766T (FANCG-mutated), sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents was observed. PL11 cells (empty vector transduced) were more sensitive to mitomycin C (MMC), cisplatin, chlorambucil, and melphalan than PL11 cells transduced with a vector wildtype FANCC. Similarly, mouse xenografts of PL11 cells (empty vector) were more sensitive to MMC or gemcitabine than PL11 cells expressing a wildtype FANCC.
929	ABL1	BCR::ABL M343T	D	Axitinib	Resistance	In a proliferation assay measuring tritiated thymidine incorporation in the presence of axitinib, Ba/F3 cells carrying the BCR-ABL1 variant showed increased incorporation when harboring fusions with the M343T variant of ABL1 compared to fusions with wildtype ABL1 (IC50 of 1175nM vs. 823 nM), indicating resistance.
922	ABL1	BCR::ABL L384M	D	Axitinib	Resistance	In a proliferation assay measuring tritiated thymidine incorporation in the presence of axitinib, Ba/F3 cells carrying the BCR-ABL1 variant showed similar incorporation when harboring fusions with the L384M variant of ABL1 compared to fusions with wildtype ABL1 (IC50 of 916nM vs. 823 nM), indicating baseline sensitivity.
930	ABL1	BCR::ABL F317V	D	Axitinib	Resistance	In a proliferation assay measuring tritiated thymidine incorporation in the presence of axitinib, Ba/F3 cells carrying the BCR-ABL1 variant showed increased incorporation when harboring fusions with the F317V variant of ABL1 compared to fusions with wildtype ABL1 (IC50 of 1320nM vs. 823 nM), indicating resistance.
454	ALK	EML4::ALK  V1180L	D	Brigatinib	Sensitivity/Response	ALK mutation V1180L was found in an H3122 derivative cell line that had become alectinib resistant after being passaged in increasing levels of alectinib. EML4-ALK V1180L and EML4-ALK wild-type were ectopically expressed in Ba/F3 cells, and brigatinib showed strong activity against both variants. The IC50 for brigatinib against EML4-ALK wild-type was 0.95, which is about 3x higher than the IC50 that was observed for alectinib, but about 6x lower than that for crizotinib. In contrast, the IC50 for brigatinib against the alectinib resistance variant EML4-ALK V1180L was 0.49, indicating increased sensitivity to brigatinib over non mutant EML4-ALK.
453	ALK	EML4::ALK  V1180L	D	TAE684	Sensitivity/Response	The V1180L mutation in the kinase domain of rearranged ALK was found in an alectinib resistant cell line named H3122 CHR-A1, which was derived from the alectinib sensitive EML4-ALK variant 1 containing NSCLC cell line H3122 by passaging into higher concentrations of alectinib. This cell line is a model for gain of alectinib resistance, and also shows resistance to crizotinib. On the other hand, the often used tool ALK inhibitor TAE684 was highly effective in killing H3122 CHR-A1, where H3122 cells were only slightly more sensitized to TAE684-induced cell death. Ectopic expression of EML4-ALK V1180L in Ba/F3 cells caused IL3 independent growth as well as marked sensitization to TAE684, to a level greater than that seen in EML4-ALK I1171T (alectinib resistance mutation) or EML4-ALK wt, and over 1000x greater sensitivity than unaltered Ba/F3 + IL3.
452	ALK	EML4::ALK  V1180L	D	Ceritinib	Sensitivity/Response	Passaging of the alectinib sensitive EML4-ALK containing H3122 NSCLC cell line with increasing levels of alectinib resulted in an alectinib resistant derivative of this cell line named H3122 CHR-A1. A V1180L missense mutation was found in the kinase domain of ALK in H3122 CHR-A1 cells. Both H3122 and H3122 CHR-A1 cells were highly and equally sensitive to ceritinib induced death. In Ba/F3 cells, ectopic expression of EML4-ALK V1180L rendered cells significantly more sensitive to ceritinib than Ba/F3 containing EML4-ALK I1171T mutant (alectinib and crizotinib resistant) or EML4-ALK wt.
451	ALK	EML4::ALK  V1180L	D	Crizotinib	Resistance	The alectinib resistant cell line H3122 CHR-A1 was generated by culturing of the EML4-ALK (variant 1) containing cell line H3122 with increasing levels of alectinib. Molecular characterization of H3122 CHR-A1 revealed a V1180L ALK kinase domain mutation. The H3122 CHR-A1 cell line required approximately 10 fold increase in crizotinib concentration to induce similar levels of cell death to H3122. Ectopic expression of EML4-ALK V1180L rendered Ba/F3 cells moderately less susceptible to crizotinib than ectopic EML4-ALK.
450	ALK	ALK FUSION I1171	D	Crizotinib	Resistance	The MGH056-1 cell line was derived from a patient with ALK rearranged NSCLC who had progressed on crizotinib and then on lower dose alectinib (300 mg twice daily). The I1171T ALK kinase domain mutation was found in this cell line (established after alectinib resistance). MGH056-1 cells were resistant to crizotinib (IC50 236nmol/L; aproximately 50x higher than for ceritinib). About 50 fold higher concentration of crizotinib was required to inhibit Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4 ALK I1171T than was required for EML4 ALK wild-type.
449	ALK	EML4::ALK  V1180L	D	Alectinib	Resistance	The EML4 ALK variant 1 containing NSCLC cell line H3122 is highly sensitive to alectinib, and an alectinib resistant derivative cell line H3122 CHR-A1 was generated by incubation of H3122 in increasing levels of alectinib culminating in 1 micro-molar, over a course of 7 months. The ALK kinase domain mutation V1180L was found in these cells, and Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4 ALK  V1180L were highly resistant to alectinib. Simulations indicated that the V1180L mutation interfered with alectinib binding. The V1180L mutation was found to be more resistant to alectinib than the I1171T mutation found in an ALK-positive NSCLC patient who developed alectinib resistance on lower dose alectinib  (300mg twice daily).
455	SIRT1	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Niacinamide	Resistance	In-vitro study with MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cell lines. Inhibition of Sirt1 by increasing concentrations of nicotinamide led to a decrease in viability. Gefitinib treatment with concentrations of 50 μM showed similar effects as observed for the application of 25 mM nicotinamide. Combinatory treatment with gefitinib and nicotinamide showed a synergistic effect on cell viability. In cell lines overexpressing Sirt1, higher concentrations of nicotinamide were required to abrogate increased cell viability mediated by Sirt1 overexpression compared to controls.
921	EGFR	VIII	D	Erlotinib	Sensitivity/Response	In an in vitro study, a Ba/F3 cell line expressing EGFR vIII demonstrated increased sensitivity to erlotinib treatment, compared to Ba/F3 cells expressing EGFR wild-type. Variant function was assessed by EGFR auto-phosphorylation. Sensitivity was assessed by cell viability assay using stable transfection of each variant and increasing concentrations of erlotinib (0–10 uM).
463	FANCC	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	D	Gemcitabine	Sensitivity/Response	In the pancreatic cell lines PL11 (FANCC homozygous deletion) and Hs766T (FANCG-mutated), sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents was observed. PL11 cells (empty vector transduced) were more sensitive to mitomycin C (MMC), cisplatin, chlorambucil, and melphalan than PL11 cells transduced with a vector wildtype FANCC. Similarly, mouse xenografts of PL11 cells (empty vector) were more sensitive to MMC or gemcitabine than PL11 cells expressing a wildtype FANCC.
465	BRCA2	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	D	Mitomycin	Sensitivity/Response	In pancreatic cell lines PL11 (FANCC-deficient) and CAPAN1 (BRCA2-mutated), sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents was observed compared to FANCC/BRCA2 wildtype cell lines (Su86.86, CFPAC, AsPc1, and MiaPaCa2). Mitomycin C specifically led to regression in 8/11 xenografts of the CAPAN1 cell line compared to 2/9 in the CFPAC (BRCA2 wildtype) cell line.
467	RB1	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Mitomycin	Resistance	In Capan-1 cell lines engineered to reduce pRB expression (by transfection with p16), resensitization to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis was observed. The effect was asserted to be specific to pRB depletion because, in two separate cell lines, also transfected with p16, that retained high pRB expression, chemotherapy resistance was still observed.
906	ABL1	BCR::ABL H396R	D	Axitinib	Resistance	In a proliferation assay measuring tritiated thymidine incorporation in the presence of axitinib, Ba/F3 cells carrying the BCR-ABL1 variant showed increased incorporation when harboring fusions with the H396R variant of ABL1 compared to fusions with wildtype ABL1 (IC50 of 1247nM vs. 823 nM), indicating resistance.
468	RB1	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Gemcitabine	Resistance	In Capan-1 cell lines engineered to reduce pRB expression (by transfection with p16), resensitization to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis was observed. The effect was asserted to be specific to pRB depletion because, in two separate cell lines, also transfected with p16, that retained high pRB expression, chemotherapy resistance was still observed.
908	ABL1	BCR::ABL F486S	D	Axitinib	Resistance	In a proliferation assay measuring tritiated thymidine incorporation in the presence of axitinib, Ba/F3 cells carrying the BCR-ABL1 variant showed similar incorporation when harboring fusions with the F486S variant of ABL1 compared to fusions with wildtype ABL1 (IC50 of 897nM vs. 823 nM), indicating baseline sensitivity.
910	ABL1	BCR::ABL E255V	D	Axitinib	Resistance	In a proliferation assay measuring tritiated thymidine incorporation in the presence of axitinib, Ba/F3 cells carrying the BCR-ABL1 variant showed increased incorporation when harboring fusions with the E255V variant of ABL1 compared to fusions with wildtype ABL1 (IC50 of 1350nM vs. 823 nM), indicating resistance.
469	RB1	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Doxorubicin	Resistance	In Capan-1 cell lines engineered to reduce pRB expression (by transfection with p16), resensitization to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis was observed. The effect was asserted to be specific to pRB depletion because, in two separate cell lines, also transfected with p16, that retained high pRB expression, chemotherapy resistance was still observed.
470	RB1	OVEREXPRESSION	D	Fluorouracil	Resistance	In Capan-1 cell lines engineered to reduce pRB expression (by transfection with p16), resensitization to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis was observed. The effect was asserted to be specific to pRB depletion because, in two separate cell lines, also transfected with p16, that retained high pRB expression, chemotherapy resistance was still observed.
474	ALK	ALK FUSION F1245C	D	Crizotinib	Resistance	A Ba/F3 cell line expressing EML4-ALK variant 1 was created, and then exposed to the DNA modifying agent ENU. Cells were subsequently cultured in 96 well plates at increasing concentrations of crizotinib (250, 500, 720, 1000, 1440 and 2000 nM). Cell growth occurred in all wells at 250 nM, and was absent at 2000 nM. From 500 through 1440 nM there were progressively fewer resistant clones present. 422 mutations representing 16 different sites were identified. EML4-ALK F1245C was found at 500 nM crizotinib, and was among the 10 most frequently observed mutations. Ba/F3 cells with unaltered EML4-ALK had crizotinib IC50 values for viability of 132 +/- 45 nM. EML4-ALK F1245C clones from the selection assay had IC50 viability value of 425 +/- 100 nM, while Ba/F3 cells expressing reintroduced EML4-ALK F1245C had IC50 value of 269 +/- 194 nM.
464	FANCC	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	D	Melphalan	Sensitivity/Response	In the pancreatic cell lines PL11 (FANCC homozygous deletion) and Hs766T (FANCG-mutated), sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents was observed. PL11 cells (empty vector transduced) were more sensitive to mitomycin C (MMC), cisplatin, chlorambucil, and melphalan than PL11 cells transduced with a vector wildtype FANCC. Similarly, mouse xenografts of PL11 cells (empty vector) were more sensitive to MMC or gemcitabine than PL11 cells expressing a wildtype FANCC.
473	ALK	EXON 4-11 DELETION	D	Brigatinib	Sensitivity/Response	The MYCN amplification positive relapsed neuroblastoma-derived cell line CLB-BAR contains the driver ALK DEL 11-14 mutation, which removes extracellular domain exons 4 through 11. Brigatinib treatment of CLB-BAR cells reduced MYCN protein levels and ALK phosphorylation (Y1604) similar to crizotnib. Brigatinib reduced CLB-BAR cellular proliferation more effectively than crizotinib (IC50 75.2 vs 186.4nM). CLB-BAR xenografts in BalbC/NUDE mice responded to brigatinib with reduced tumor volume and weight (N=8/group) as well as reduced ALK phosphorylation and MYCN levels compared to untreated controls. Release of brigatinib administration at day 15 resulted in tumor growth (N=2).
1	BRAF	V600E AND AMPLIFICATION	E	Selumetinib	Resistance	COLO201 and COLO206F cells harboring BRAF V600E mutations were cloned to be MEK inhibitor (AZD6244 [selumetinib]) resistant. The mechanism of this resistance was shown to be amplification of the BRAF V600E gene. BRAF V600E amplification was observed in 1/11 colorectal cancer patient samples evaluated, indicating this subclone (28% of cells) would be MEK inhibitor resistant.
438	ALK	EML4::ALK E2-E20	E		Sensitivity/Response	Adenocarcinoma cells were detected via urinary cytology in a 53 year old woman. Cancer morphology suggested papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC), type 2A.  EML4-ALK variant 5 was discovered in tumor tissue using PCR with EML4 and ALK specific primers. The authors conclude that their findings confirm the potential for ALK targeting therapy in select cases of RCC.
689	AKT3	OVEREXPRESSION	E	Pan-AKT Kinase Inhibitor GSK690693	Sensitivity/Response	AKT3 was found to be preferentially required for the proliferation and tumor growth of TNBC. It was found to be upregulated in a set of TNBC cell lines compared to other breast cancer types. Depletion of AKT3 in TNBC sensitizes cells to the pan-Akt inhibitor GSK690693. It was found that depletion of Akt3 potentially inhibits the growth of TNBC cell lines in three-dimensional (3D) spheroid cultures and in mouse xenograft models, which imply that therapeutic targeting of AKT3 may provide a new treatment option for TNBCs.
471	ALK	FUSION	E	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	26 colorectal adenocarcinoma samples were run on Affymetrix human Exon 1.0 arrays and a computational method that assessed differential 5' and 3' gene expression for each gene was used to find potential rearrangements.  One sample showed potential rearrangement and RT-PCR demonstrated an EML4-ALK fusion where EML4 exon 21 was fused to ALK exon 13. This EML4-ALK variant is different from those commonly found in NSCLC. Genomic PCR verified the existence of the fusion breakpoint in intronic space, indicating that some colorectal adenocarcinoma may have targetable ALK-fusion driver mutations.
458	ROS1	REARRANGEMENT	E	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	A tissue microarray of 268 patients with histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma was performed to search for ROS1 gene fusion events to guide potential targeted therapy in future cases. Break apart FISH assay, which does not distinguish ROS1-fusion partner, was used on the tissue microarray to determine ROS1 fusion status. 2 cases of ROS1 fusions were found. 1 case was verified by RT-PCR to be a SLC34A2-ROS1 fusion, but this case was also positive for BRAF V600E.  The second case of ROS1 fusion was of undetermined fusion partner, where known ROS1 fusion parters SLC34A2, CD74 and SDC4 were tested. This case did not have KRAS or BRAF mutations, indicating that ROS1 fusion may act in a small subset of colorectal cancer as a driver targetable by crizotinib or other inhibitors.

602	FBXW7	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	E	Everolimus	Sensitivity/Response	mTOR protein levels were found to underly a circadian 24-hour rhythm regulated by time-dependent Fbxw7-mediated ubiquitination. Survival rates of tumor-bearing mice with everolimus showed time-dependency consistent with mTOR protein levels. It could be hypothesized that FBXW7 loss leads to an increase in mTOR protein levels independent of circadian regulation and higher sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors.
28	MGMT	PROMOTER METHYLATION	E	O6-Benzylguanine	Sensitivity/Response	In patients lacking MGMT promoter methylation, the use of an MGMT inhibitor, such as O(6)-benzylguanine, in combination with alkylating agents (Carmustine) may be useful in treating patients with initial resistance to alkylating agents.
245	PRKAA2	T172 PHOSPHORYLATION	E	ACLY SiRNA	Sensitivity/Response	Low levels of baseline p-AMPK (PRKAA2, measured at Thr172) were predictive of efficacy of ACLY inhibition by siRNA in cell lines of various cancer histologies.
472	ALK	FUSION	E	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	84 breast cancer samples acquired from commercial sources were assayed on Affymetrix human exon 1.0 arrays. A computational method was used to find potential gene fusions which assessed differential exon expression between the 3' and 5' ends of each gene. Two potential fusions were found and assessed using RNA ligase mediated rapid amplifiation of cDNA ends and RT-PCR. The fusions were EML4-ALK variants 1 and 2. Genomic PCR identified fusion breakpoints, and these differed from breakpoints for these EML4-ALK variants reported in NSCLC.
397	ALK	EML4::ALK E2-E20	E	Crizotinib	Sensitivity/Response	Multiplex RT-PCR to detect in-frame fusions of EML4 to ALK was performed on total RNA from 253 lung adenocarcinomas, and 9 samples were found to contain such fusions, one of which was a novel fusion containing EML4 exon 2 and exon 20 of ALK. This was called variant 5. Two versions of this variant were seen: 5a consisted of EML4 exon 2 fused to ALK exon 20 while 5b contained a 117bp intronic ALK region between the two exons. Genomic PCR showed that EML4-ALK variant 5 tumor cells contained a single EML4-ALK fusion, suggesting 5a and 5b arise from alternate splicing.  5a and 5b showed in-vitro kinase activity and transformed 3T3 cells in cell culture. 5a and 5b transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors when injected in 8/8 nude mice, but 3T3 transformed with ALK alone did not.  These results suggest that EML4-ALK variant 5 is a driver mutation in lung adenocarcinoma targetable by ALK inhibitors like crizotinib.
