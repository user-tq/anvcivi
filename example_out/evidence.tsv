17877814(PubMed)	MCF-7 cells were transduced with YFP tagged EGFR with E746_A750delELREA mutation, or YFP EGFR wildtype, and stained for ectopic YFP EGFR and phospho-Akt as a readout for EGFR pathway activity. Increased p-Akt stain was seen with ectopic mutant EGFR over wildtype cells. Parallel erlotinib incubations of cells with wildtype EGFR induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien only at high concentration (10uM). Addition of erlotinib to mutant EGFR cell incubations reduced p-Akt signal and induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien at considerably lower conecntration (100 nM) erlotinib.  These results indicate the EGFR L858R variant as a growth pathway driver targetable by erlotinib.

27612423(PubMed)	In an in vitro study, CHO and NCI-H3255 cells expressing EGFR L858R mutation were associated with sensitivity to erlotinib treatment. Sensitivity was determined by assessing cell density.
22235099(PubMed)	This study analyzed patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were positive for EML4-ALK fusions (ALK+) and progressed on crizotinib monotherapy. One patient was biopsied twice following crizotinib progression and once pre-treatment. This patient was a 27 year old female with one pack year who experienced partial response on crizotinib as 4th line therapy. The patient's pre-crizotinib biopsy was ALK+ and lacked the EGFR mutation. A biopsy taken after 63 days on crizotinib showed EGFR L858R mutation and lacked ALK gene rearrangement by FISH (ALK Loss). Of note, a second post-treatment biopsy (after 113 on crizotinib) showed ALK rearrangement but lacked EGFR mutation. The authors interpreted the emergence of an ALK negative tumor (first post-critozitinib biopsy) as evidence of a separate oncogenic driver (EGFR L858R).
27032107(PubMed)	In a prospective study of 46 Caucasian, advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients harboring EGFR mutations, first-line erlotinib treatment was assessed. Average PFS and OS for these 46 patients was 11 months (95% CI: 9.7-12.3 months) and 23 months (95% CI: 21.3-28.6+ months), respectively. A PFS rate of 81% at three months met the primary endpoint of presumed superiority over chemotherapy. Clinical benefit (CR+PR+SD) rate was 81%. Fifteen patients harbored EGFR L858R mutations, which was the only mutation found in exon 21. The authors note similar response profiles for exon 19 (27/46) and exon 21 mutations (15/46) to the overall population.
27102076(PubMed)	In an in vitro study, Ba/F3 cell line expressing EGFR L858R was associated with sensitivity to erlotinib treatment (IC50 26.9 ± 12.4). Sensitivity was determined by assessing cell viability, AKT and ERK phosphorylation, and EGFR auto-phosphorylation.
27102076(PubMed)	In an in vitro study, Ba/F3 cell line expressing EGFR L858R did not show sensitivity to cetuximab treatment, while cells expressing EGFR-RAD51 fusion were sensitive. Sensitivity was determined by assessing cell viability, AKT and ERK phosphorylation and EGFR auto-phosphorylation.
24893891(PubMed)	In an in vitro study using NCI-H3255 cells (EGFR L858R mutation), inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation was used as an assay to determine sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Sensitivity was assessed by cell viability assay using stable transfection of each variant and increasing concentrations of erlotinib (0–10 uM).
26768165(PubMed)	The authors pooled patients with exon 19 deletion and L858R EGFR (Exon 21) mutations from both studies (The ARCHER 1009 (NCT01360554) and A7471028 (NCT00769067)) to compare the efficacy of dacomitinib to erlotinib. 121 patients with any EGFR mutation were enrolled, 101 had activating mutations in exon 19 or 21. For those (exon19/21), the median PFS was 14.6 months with dacomitinib and 9.6 months with erlotinib The median survival was 26.6 months with dacomitinib versus 23.2 months with erlotinib.
27022112(PubMed)	In a Japanese Phase III clinical trial, noninferiority of Gefitinib as compared to Erlotinib was assessed in 561 postoperative recurrent or stage IIIb/VI patients who had undergone prior chemotherapy treatment but no tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. In a subset of patients with sole EGFR L858R, there was an insignificant difference between the objective response and disease control rates for patients treated with erlotinib (N=67) and gefitinib (N=78). Progression free survival was also not significantly different and did not meet the noninferiority endpoint with Gefitinib and Erlotinib arms at 8.1 and 8.5 months, respectively (HR, 0.938; 95% CI, 0.675 to 1.304; P = .704).

26125448(PubMed)	83 patients from a phase II trial (docetaxel + placebo or MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib) with KRAS mutant tumors were retrospectively assessed for differences in OS, PFS, ORR and change in tumor size at week 6 according to type of KRAS mutation. G12C, G12D and G12V were the most common mutations (46%, 22%, 11%, respectively). Patients with G12C or G12V mutations receiving selumetinib and docetaxel combined treatment had a trend towards longer OS, PFS and ORR compared to other KRAS mutations, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. Changes in tumor size were similar between groups with the best responses in tumors with G12V mutations. Few differences were observed between groups when treated with docetaxel + placebo.

26739882(PubMed)	Preclinical study to investigate mechanisms of KRAS G12C activity and inhibition with ARS-853, a covalent (irreversible) inhibitor which binds KRAS G12C in the GDP-bound state to prevent activation. Results from a mass spectrometry-based assay to evaluate KRAS activity suggests that G12C mutant KRAS is in a “hyperexcitable” rather than a “statically active” state. ARS-853 targets the inactive state and inhibited proliferation in a subset  (3/11) of KRAS G12C mutant cell lines in 2-D growth assays and 11/11 cell lines in soft-agar colony formation and 3-D assays. This effect was specific for KRAS G12C as 12/12 cell lines with other KRAS mutations (including other G12 mutations V, D and A) were not inhibited in either soft-agar assay.  Relative resistance to ARS-853 developed after epidermal growth factor (50 ng/mL) administration and the combination of erlotinib or afatinib (EGFR-inhibitors) with ARS-853 greatly potentiated growth arrest, apoptosis and decrease of PI3K and MAPK-signaling over single-agent ARS-853 treatment, even in the presence of added EGF.

23313110(PubMed)	In a study of 448 metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with EGFR-TKIs and tested for EGFR and KRAS mutations, 69 tested positive for KRAS mutations. In 38 EGFR wildtype patients treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, those with KRAS G12C mutations (n=24) had shorter progression free survival rates compared to patients with non-G12C KRAS mutations (n=14; 4.3 vs 9 weeks; P = 0.009; HR=2.7). This was true when restricted to patients with an adenocarcinoma subtype only (n=18 vs 12; 4.1 vs 9 weeks; P = 0.007; HR=3.1). Overall survival was not different between groups.

18316791(PubMed)	In a retrospective study of 427 metastatic colorectal patients, KRAS mutations were observed in 43% of the tumor samples. Patients with mutations in codon 12 or 13 of KRAS were associated with reduced response to panitumumab compared to wildtype KRAS (HR:0.99, 95% CI:0.73-1.36 vs. HR:0.45, 95% CI:0.34-0.59; P<0.0001). Additionally, patients with KRAS mutations showed no significant improvement between treatment with panitumumab and best supportive care alone (PFS: 7.4 wk vs 7.3 wk).
17409929(PubMed)	In recurrent lung cancer patients treated with the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib, patients with KRAS mutations had a lower frequency of partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) and a higher rate of progressive disease (PD) (PR:0, SD:1, PD:15 vs. PR:24, SD:8, PD:14; P=0.0274) compared to wildtype KRAS patients. Patients with KRAS mutations also had a shorter overall survival compared to wildtype KRAS patients (HR:2.542, 95% CI:1.048-6.168, P=0.0390).
19284554(PubMed)	In a study of patients receiving melphalan-based therapy, those with KRAS codon 12 mutations were less likely to have a positive response than those with wildtype KRAS (26.9% vs. 58.3%, P=0.015).

20619739(PubMed)	This was a retrospective study of 691 cetuximab treated patients with metastatic, chemotherapy refractory colorectal cancer. Of those, 16 patients harbored KRAS G12C, were BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA wt, and had individual response data. One patient had a partial response, 6 had stable disease, and 9 progressed. Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=15) and cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=1). Median PFS was 11 weeks (6-65 weeks), median OS was 24 weeks (14-91 weeks), and median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 2 (1-6). Median age was 62 years old (46-73), and there were 8 males and 8 females. Using these data and data from the larger cohort, authors concluded that KRAS mutation was strongly associated with poor response to cetuximab and suggested that mutation status of KRAS is the most informative compared to BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 for predicting cetuximab response.

Of those, 16 patients harbored KRAS G12C, were BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA wt, and had individual response data. One patient had a partial response, 6 had stable disease, and 9 progressed. Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=15) and cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=1). Median PFS was 11 weeks (6-65 weeks), median OS was 24 weeks (14-91 weeks), and median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 2 (1-6). Median age was 62 years old (46-73), and there were 8 males and 8 females. Using these data and data from the larger cohort, authors concluded that KRAS mutation was strongly associated with poor response to cetuximab and suggested that mutation status of KRAS is the most informative compared to BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 for predicting cetuximab response.
26161928(PubMed)	In an in vitro study, a human colon adenocarcinoma SW48 cell line expressing KRAS G12C mutation demonstrated resistance to regorafenib treatment (IC50: 386.22 nM vs. 114.28 nM, P<0.01) compared to SW48 cells expressing KRAS wild-type. Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability. In vivo, KRAS G12C expressing SW48 cells were injected into NOD/SCID mice. Treatment with regorafenib did not lead to a significant delay of tumor growth. Mice injected with KRAS wt cells did not significantly respond to regorafenib, although a trend was seen toward better response. IHC analysis of mouse tissue revealed no significant change in markers of proliferation (Ki67), angiogenesis (CD31) and apoptosis (TUNEL) in KRAS G12C expressing mice treated with regorafenib compared to KRAS wt expressing mice whose tumors displayed more pronounced changes. Authors concluded that G12C was more resistant to regorafenib than KRAS wt and other common KRAS G12/G13 mutants.

Baseline biopsies were obtained before therapy initiation with pembrolizumab (before prior vemurafenib treatment in patient 1). A JAK1 Q503* mutation was observed at the time of relapse in patient 1. This mutation was one of 3 new homozygous mutations in this patient (53 new mutations total) and the tumor was described to be genetically similar to the pre-treatment tumor. CRIPR-Cas9 mediated modelling of the JAK1 mutation in a melanoma cell line led to a loss of response to interferon alpha, beta and gamma.
27433843(PubMed)	Paired tumor samples were analyzed from four patients with metastatic melanoma and initial response with a subsequent relapse under pembrolizumab (PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor) therapy. Baseline biopsies were obtained before therapy initiation with pembrolizumab. A JAK2 F547 splice site mutation was observed at the time of relapse in patient 2. RNA sequencing revealed an in-frame stop codon after exon 12. The JAK2 mutation was the only homozygous mutation (allele frequency >85%) of 76 new nonsynonymous mutations in patient 2. Cell line modelling of baseline and relapse JAK2 mutational status revealed a loss of response to interferon gamma and  loss of JAK2 protein. This loss of response was also modeled in another cell line.
