0	NRAS:NM_002524:exon3:c.C181A:p.Q61K	Neuroblastoma	Binimetinib,Everolimus	In-vitro study in 5 neuroblastoma cell lines (2 with NRAS Q61K mutation). The combination of mTOR and MEK Inhibitors synergistically blocked cell growth in NRAS mutant but not wild type cell lines. Single agent MEK inhibition (AZD6244/selumetinib, MEK162 or PD0325901) and single agent mTOR inhibition (Everolimus or AZD8055) also blocked cell growth in NRAS mutant cell lines, whereas single agent PI3K inhibitors or MEK Inhibitors in combination with PIK3CA/AKT inhibitors did not show synergistic effects.
1	NRAS:NM_002524:exon3:c.C181A:p.Q61K	Skin Melanoma	Vemurafenib	Preclinical study in melanoma cell lines. NRAS Q61K, in addition to the BRAF V600E mutation was associated with resistance to vemurafenib but sensitivity to AZD6244 (selumetinib) in vitro in the acquired resistant cell line M249-AR4 and in the patient-derived acquired resistant cell line M376.
2	NRAS:NM_002524:exon3:c.C181A:p.Q61K	Skin Melanoma	Selumetinib	Preclinical study in melanoma cell lines. NRAS Q61K, in addition to the BRAF V600E mutation was associated with resistance to vemurafenib but sensitivity to AZD6244 (selumetinib) in vitro in the acquired resistant cell line M249-AR4 and in the patient-derived acquired resistant cell line M376.
3	NRAS:NM_002524:exon3:c.C181A:p.Q61K	Colorectal Cancer	Chemotherapy,Cetuximab	Four patients participating in a large retrospective study of cetuximab in metastatic, treatment refractory colorectal cancer had tumors which harbored NRAS Q61K and were wildtype for KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA. One patient experienced partial response and three patients experienced progressive disease. The four patients whose tumors harbored NRAS Q61K included an 80 year old male treated with cetuximab and irinotecan as a 3rd line treatment who experienced progressive disease and had PFS of 6 weeks and OS of 43 weeks; a 51 year old male treated with cetuximab and ironotecan as a 3rd line therapy who experienced a partial response and had PFS of 24 weeks and OS of 54 weeks; a 64 year old male treated with cetuximab and ironotecan as a 5th line therapy who experienced progressive disease and had PFS of 8 weeks and OS of 33 weeks; and a 65 year old female treated with cetuximab, oxaliplatin and 5FU as a 2nd line therapy who experienced progressive disease and had PFS of 31 weeks and OS of 50 weeks.
4	NRAS:NM_002524:exon3:c.C181A:p.Q61K	Colorectal Cancer	Dactolisib,Selumetinib	In 28 out of 40 (70%) metastatic colorectal cancer tumors harboring mutations in KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, or PIK3CA and implanted into mice, the therapeutic combination of the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 and the PI3K/mTor inhibitor BEZ235 resulted in disease stabilization. Mean tumor growth was lower in the tumors treated with AZD6244+ BEZ235 (+77% vs. +267%, P=1E-6) compared to AZD6244 alone and (+77% vs. +222%, P=0.0014) BEZ235 alone. NRAS mutations were in 4/40 tumors (three Q61K, one G12D).
5	NRAS:NM_002524:exon3:c.C181A:p.Q61K	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Trametinib,Selumetinib	Of the 4,562 patients with lung cancers, 30 showed NRAS mutations, which corresponded to 9 different amino acid substitutions. Cell lines were developed for 6 of these mutations (one harboring Q61L, two Q61R, and three Q61K mutations) and 5/6 were sensitive to MEK inhibitors selumetinib and trametinib. One Q61K line was not sensitive to these inhibitors.
6	NRAS:NM_002524:exon3:c.C181A:p.Q61K	Ovary Serous Adenocarcinoma	Trametinib	One 56 year old female with advanced recurrent low grade serous ovarian cancer with NRAS Q61K mutation had a partial response to trametinib, with short follow-up.
7	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon2:c.G333C:p.K111N	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	Pictilisib	This preclinical study tested the efficacy on several breast cancer cell lines of GDC-0941 (pictilisib), a selective inhibitor of all four isoforms of class I PI3-kinases at a range of IC50 values. Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. BT-474 is a HER2 amplified breast cancer cell line harboring PIK3CA K111N, and it had an IC50 of 0.23uM. To evaluate in vivo efficacy, cells were injected in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice and allowed to grow. Mice subsequently treated with 100mg/kg pictilisib experienced a 69% tumor reduction, and those treated with 150mg/kg experienced an 82% tumor reduction, with respect to untreated control. Authors note that pictilisib was well tolerated and observed no toxicities or significant weight loss. Authors further note that HER2 amplified cell lines were generally more sensitive, regardless of mutation, to pictilisib than basal-like cell lines (p=0.002).
8	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon2:c.G333C:p.K111N	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	Trastuzumab Emtansine	As part of a pre-clinical experiment, the efficacy of ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) was evaluated against various HER2 positive cell lines. BT-474 cell line expressing PIK3CA K111N was associated with similar sensitivity to T-DM1 as PIK3CA wild-type cell line SK-BR-3; reduced cell viability was observed at concentrations > 0.01 ug/mL in both cell lines. Conversely, when treated with trastuzumab, the cell line harboring PIK3CA K111N experienced a smaller reduction in cell viability. Further, treatment with T-DM1 on SCID mice xenografted with PIK3CA K111N cells resulted in inhibition of tumor growth. A single dose of T-DM1 >5mg/kg was sufficient to induce tumor regression >20 days after administration.
9	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon2:c.G333C:p.K111N	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	PI-103	As part of a preclinical study, the efficacy of PI-103 was evaluated for several cell lines of breast cancer. Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. BT-474 is a HER2 receptor amplified breast cancer cell line harboring PIK3CA K111N, and it had an IC50 of 0.60uM.
10	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon2:c.G333C:p.K111N	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	PI3Ka/Di	As part of a preclinical study, the efficacy of PI3KA/Di—a selective inhibitor for the α and δ subunits of class I PI3K—was evaluated for several cell lines of breast cancer. Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. BT-474 is a HER2 amplified breast cancer cell line harboring PIK3CA K111N and it had an IC50 of 0.52uM.
11	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon2:c.G333C:p.K111N	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	Trastuzumab,Dactolisib,Lapatinib	The BT-474 HER2 positive human breast cancer cell line, which is heterozygous for the PIK3CA K111N mutation, demonstrated strongly reduced colony formation when treated with lapatinib, trastuzumab or dactolisib alone or in combination, suggesting that K111N does not induce resistance to these drugs.
12	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon2:c.G333C:p.K111N	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	Trastuzumab	As part of a pre-clinical experiment, the efficacy of trastuzumab was evaluated against various HER2 positive cell lines in cell viability assays. BT-474 cell line expressing PIK3CA K111N was associated with similar sensitivity to trastuzumab as PIK3CA wild-type cell line SK-BR-3, at all concentrations tested (0-10 ug/mL).
13	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon21:c.A3140G:p.H1047R	Colorectal Cancer	Cetuximab,Panitumumab	In this study, a large cohort of metastatic colorectal cancer patients were treated with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab or panitumumab). KRAS PIK3CA and PTEN were tested for mutation; PIK3CA H1047R was the only variant noted in the primary tumor (located in rectum) of one patient who experienced partial response (patient 38; Supplemental Table 1), following treatment. In the larger cohort, patients with tumors harboring any PIK3CA mutation had significantly shorter progression free survival and decreased incidence of objective response than patients with wtPIK3CA tumors.
14	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon21:c.A3140G:p.H1047R	Breast Cancer	PI3K-alpha Inhibitor MEN1611	Breast cancer cell lines with H1047R mutation showed increased sensitivity to CH5132799 than cells with wild-type PIK3CA gene.
15	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon21:c.A3140G:p.H1047R	Colorectal Cancer	Cetuximab,Panitumumab	In this study, a large cohort of metastatic colorectal cancer patients were treated with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab or panitumumab). KRAS PIK3CA and PTEN were tested for mutation; PIK3CA H1047R was the only variant noted in the primary tumors of four patients (Patient Ids: 7, 42, 52, 64; Table S1) and the metastatic tumor of one patient (11; Table S1), who experienced disease progression following treatment. It was also noted in the primary tumors of 3 patients (25, 48, 88; Table S1) who experienced stable disease following treatment.This response was consistent with observations made of the larger cohort, where patients with tumors harboring any PIK3CA mutation had significantly shorter progression free survival and decreased incidence of objective response than patients with wtPIK3CA tumors. However, one patient (38, Table S1) had PIK3CA H1047R as the only noted variant, but experienced partial response.
16	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon21:c.A3140G:p.H1047R	Head And Neck Cancer	Dactolisib	Lentiviral transduction of PIK3CA H1047R mutation into head and neck cancer cell line SCC25 led to increased sensitivity to PI3K/mTOR inhibition with BEZ235 compared to unmanipulated cells (IC50 values 6 nM and 31 nM).
17	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon21:c.A3140G:p.H1047R	Head And Neck Cancer	Dactolisib	"Two head and neck cancer cell lines with PIK3CA H1047R mutation were more sensitive to PI3K/mTOR inhibition with BEZ-235 (NVP-BEZ235, Dactolisib) than two wild type cell lines in vitro. One cell line with H1047R mutation was also found to be sensitive to BEZ-235 in vivo. PIK3CA (H1047R) mutation positive cell lines used were ""CAL-33"" and ""Detroit 562"". Wild type cell lines used here were ""SCC-9"" and ""PE/CA-PJ34(clone C12)""."
18	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon21:c.A3140G:p.H1047R	Head And Neck Cancer	Cetuximab,Dactolisib	Xenografts from one head and neck cancer cell line (CAL-33) with a PIK3CA H1047R mutation were more sensitive to the combined inhibition of PI3K/mTOR and EGFR with BEZ-235 and cetuximab (N=9) than cetuximab (N=9, P=0.0039) or BEZ-235 alone (N=9, P=0.0002) in-vivo.
19	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon21:c.A3140G:p.H1047R	Head And Neck Cancer	Alpelisib	In a panel of head and neck cancer cell lines, 2 lines containing the PIK3CA mutation H1047R (Detroit562 and SNU-1076) were more sensitive to growth inhibition (IC50 1.10 and 6.82) by the PI3Kalpha specific inhibitor BYL719 (Alepelisib) than 3 of 4 lines with wild type PI3K (SNU-1066 IC50 1.13 μM; SNU-1041, 20.65 μM; FaDu, 19.67 μM; SCC25, 49.30 μM). In the H1047R mutant cell lines and the wildtype cell line tested, phospho-Akt and phospho-S6 levels were diminished with increasing BYL719 levels.
20	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon21:c.A3140G:p.H1047R	Lung Adenocarcinoma	Dactolisib	Doxycycline dependent expression of the PIK3CA H1047R mutation in mouse type II alveolar epithelial cells drove lung cancer in a reversible fashion, indicating the driver properties of this p110alpha catalytic domain mutation. Administration of pan-p110 isoform and mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 to H1047R mice with established tumors resulted in reduced tumor phospho-Akt and phosoho-S6 levels, and significant regression of tumor volume.
21	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon21:c.A3140G:p.H1047R	Head And Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma	Taselisib	The Cal-33 HNSCC cell line with H1047R mutation was found to have a low antiproliferative IC50 value for the alpha, gamma and delta isoform-specific PI3K inhibitor taselisib. Increasing taselisib concentration induced reduction of phospho-Akt levels in Call-33 cells, while upregulating the cleaved PARP apoptotic marker. Among a panel of 26 HNSCC cell lines, activating PI3K mutations were associated with taselisib sensitivity in comparison to wild-type PI3K or PTEN mutant cell lines.
22	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon21:c.A3140G:p.H1047R	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	Trastuzumab,Capivasertib	Tumor xenografts in mice were established with the KPL4 HER2 positive breast cancer cell line with PIK3CA H1047R mutation. KPL4 has suboptimal responses to trastuzumab and lapatinib. Xengraft treatment with trastuzumab and AZD5363 monotherapy induced moderate growth inhibition which was significant for AZD5363, but co-treatment with trastuzumab and AZD5363 induced significant tumor regression and enhanced growth delay upon removal of treatment.
23	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon21:c.A3140G:p.H1047R	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	Lapatinib,Capivasertib	The HER2 breast cancer cell line KPL4 with PIK3CA H1047R shows sub-optimal responses to trastuzumab and lapatinib, and was used to establish mouse xenografts. Treatment of mice with monotherapy of AZD5363 or lapatinib alone induced growth inhibition (37%, not significant; 65%, P = 0.004), but treatment with AZD5363 and lapatinib together induced significant tumor regression (109%, P < 0.0001) as well as delayed tumor regrowth after removal of therapy.
24	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon21:c.A3140G:p.H1047R	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	Everolimus,Fulvestrant	Case report of a 44-year-old patient with recurrent HER2-positive breast cancer. The primary tumor was HR positive; however, the metastatic tumor was HR negative. The patient was resistant to classical chemotherapeutic agents and anti-HER2 treatment. Thus, the combination of everolimus and fulvestrant was administered. The patient experienced stable disease and PFS of 10 months. Genetic testing of pleural effusion after disease progression revealed a PIK3CA H1047R gene mutation but was positive for PTEN expression (IHC).
25	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon21:c.A3140G:p.H1047R	Thyroid Gland Cancer	Temsirolimus,Perifosine	Preclinical study in thyroid cancer cell lines. 6 cell lines with alterations of the PI3K/Akt pathway were more sensitive to Akt inhibitor perifosine or MTOR inhibitor temsirolimus than 5 cell lines without genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway. Among the alterations, One cell line harbored a PIK3CA H1047R mutation. Transfection of another cell line with this mutation led to lower IC50 values to perifosine and temsirolimus than in a cell line transfected with a control vector. Perifosine treatment also increased apoptosis of a thyroid tumor xenograft with PIK3CA H1047R mutation.
26	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon21:c.A3140G:p.H1047R	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	Pictilisib	This preclinical study tested the efficacy on several breast cancer cell lines of GDC-0941 (pictilisib), a selective inhibitor of all four isoforms of class I PI3-kinases at a range of IC50 values. Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. KPL4 is a HER2 amplified breast cancer cell line harboring PIK3CA H1047R, and it had an IC50 of 0.28uM. To evaluate in vivo efficacy, cells were injected in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice, and allowed to grow. Subsequently, pictilisib was administered orally daily for 14 days. Mice treated with 100mg/kg experienced a 76% tumor reduction, and those treated with 150mg/kg experienced a 90% tumor reduction, with respect to untreated control. Phosphorylated AKT (S473) was substantially reduced with pictilisib administration. Three other HER2 amplified breast cancer cell lines harbored PIK3CA H1047R: UACC-893, HCC1954, MDA-MB-453, which had IC50s of 0.41uM, 0.49uM, and 0.64uM, suggesting that PIK3CA H1047R induces sensitivity to pictilisib in HER2 amplified breast cancer. Authors note that pictilisib was well tolerated in vivo and further note that HER2 amplified cell lines were generally more sensitive, regardless of mutation, to pictilisib than basal-like cell lines (p=0.002).
27	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon21:c.A3140G:p.H1047R	Breast Cancer	Pictilisib	This preclinical study tested the efficacy of GDC-0941, a selective inhibitor of class I PI3K, on several cell lines of breast cancer. Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. Three cell lines harbored PIK3CA H1047R. T-47D is a luminal type breast cancer cell line, and it had an IC50 of 0.22uM. Treatment with GDC-0941 resulted in a substantial reduction of phosphorylated AKT. BT-20 is a basal breast cancer cell line which had an ICD50 of 0.62uM. MFM-223 is basal cell line that had an ICD50 of 2.10uM, and experienced some reduction in pAKT. Authors note that luminal-like cell lines were generally more sensitive to GDC-0941 than basal-like (p=0.02).
28	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon21:c.A3140G:p.H1047R	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	Trastuzumab Emtansine	As part of a pre-clinical experiment, the efficacy of ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) was compared to that of trastuzumab against various HER2 positive cell lines. HCC1954 and KPL-4 cell lines expressing PIK3CA H1047R were associated with similar sensitivity to T-DM1 as PIK3CA wild-type cell line SK-BR-3; reduced cell viability was observed at concentrations > 0.01 ug/mL in all three cell lines. Conversely, the cell lines harboring PIK3CA H1047R were resistant to trastuzumab in vitro at all concentrations tested (0-10 ug/mL). Further, treatment with T-DM1 on SCID mice xenografted with KPL-4 (PIK3CA H1047R cells) resulted in inhibition of tumor growth. A single dose of T-DM1 >5mg/kg was sufficient to induce tumor regression >20 days after administration.
29	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon21:c.A3140G:p.H1047R	Colorectal Cancer	Vemurafenib	In an in vitro study, a RKO cell line expressing BRAF V600E (a known vemurafenib sensitizing mutation) and PIK3CA H1047R co-mutation demonstrated reduced sensitivity to vemurafenib treatment. Resistance was determined by assessing cellular proliferation and AKT phosphorylation.
30	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon21:c.A3140G:p.H1047R	Colorectal Cancer	Cetuximab,Irinotecan	Five patients participating in a large retrospective study of cetuximab in metastatic, treatment refractory colorectal cancer had tumors which harbored PIK3CA H1047R (exon 21), were wildtype for KRAS, BRAF and NRAS, and had individual response data. All patients were treated with cetuximab and irinotecan, four as 3rd line therapy, one as 4th line. Patient characteristics are as follows: a 65 year old female who experienced stable disease (PFS: 33 weeks, OS: 37 weeks); a 56 year old female who experienced stable disease (PFS: 28 weeks, OS: 43 weeks); a 69 year old female who experienced progressive disease (PFS: 10 weeks, OS: 28 weeks); a 63 year old male who experienced progressive disease (PFS:11 weeks, OS: 18 weeks); a 60 year old female who experienced progressive disease (PFS: 12 weeks, OS: 34 weeks). Based off this information and clinical data compiled from the larger cohort, authors concluded that PIK3CA exon 21 (listed as exon 20 in source) mutations predict poor response to cetuximab.
31	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon21:c.A3140G:p.H1047R	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	Trastuzumab,Lapatinib	In a preclinical study, efficacy of lapatinib and trastuzumab was evaluated in vitro against HER2 amplified breast cancer cell line BT474 (heterozygous for PIK3CA K111N) retrovirally transduced with PIK3CA H1047R. The study found that H1047R abrogated the growth inhibitory effects of lapatinib and trastuzumab, either in isolation or in combination, though somewhat increased cell death was observed with combination therapy relative to monotherapy. The authors concluded that the PIK3CA H1047R induces resistance to lapatinib and trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer cells.
32	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon21:c.A3140G:p.H1047R	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	Dactolisib	This preclinical study tested the sensitivity of HER2-positive breast cancer cell line BT-474 (heterozygous for PIK3CA K111N) retrovirally transduced with PIK3CA H1047R to NVP-BEZ235 (dactolisib; a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor). The study found that dactolisib was effective in inhibiting outgrowth of H1047R mutant-containing cells. Dactolisib was also combined with trastuzumab and/or lapatinib with similar abrogation of growth for PIK3CA H1047R expressing cells. Additionally, growth of untransduced BT-474 control cells was prevented by treatment with any monotherapy or combination of trastuzumab, lapatinib, or dactolisib. Authors concluded that PIK3CA H1047R induces resistance to lapatinib and trastuzumab in HER2 positive breast cancer cells, but resistance can be reversed by dactolisib.
33	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon21:c.A3140G:p.H1047R	Colorectal Cancer	Vemurafenib,Akt Inhibitor MK2206	Resistance of RKO cells, which harbor BRAF V600E (a known vemurafenib sensitizing mutation) and PIK3CA H1047R, to vemurafenib monotherapy was abrogated by the addition of pan-AKT inhibitor MK-2206 in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, vemurafenib and MK-2206 combination treatment of RKO cells resulted in substantially greater proliferation inhibition than either agent in isolation or untreated control cells (combination index score = 0.691 at EC50). Synergistic effects of vemurafenib and MK-2206 on RKO cells was confirmed in vivo via xenografts on an athymic mouse model, where mice treated with vemurafenib monotherapy experienced minimal tumor growth inhibition (25%), mice treated with MK-2206 monotherapy experienced modest tumor growth inhibition (37%), and mice treated with both achieved 87% tumor growth inhibition compared to vehicle treated control mice (P <0.001).
34	PIK3CA:NM_006218:exon21:c.A3140G:p.H1047R	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	Trastuzumab	As part of a pre-clinical experiment, the efficacy of trastuzumab was evaluated against various HER2 positive cell lines. CC1954 and KPL-4 cell lines expressing PIK3CA H1047R were associated with resistance to trastuzumab compared to PIK3CA wild-type cell line SK-BR-3, at all concentrations tested (0-10 ug/mL).
35	KIT:NM_000222:exon17:c.A2447T:p.D816V	Systemic Mastocytosis	Midostaurin	In a phase II clinical trial, 60% of patients (N=89) with advanced systemic mastocytosis responded to treatment with midostaurin.
36	KIT:NM_000222:exon17:c.A2447T:p.D816V	Cancer	Imatinib	In an in vitro study of imatinib sensitivity, KIT D816V was cloned into a plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis of KIT WT cDNA. Chinese hamster ovary cells were transiently transfected with the plasmid. Cells were treated with control media or media containing various concentrations of imatinib for 90 minutes. Protein lysates from the transfected cells were examined for phosphorylated tyrosine, a measure of KIT activation. Cells expressing KIT D816V were resistant to imatinib up to 10 umol/L.
37	KIT:NM_000222:exon17:c.A2447T:p.D816V	Cancer	Dasatinib,Imatinib	In an in vitro study, COS-7 cells expressing KIT D816V activating mutation demonstrated resistance to 1uM dasatinib treatment. In a separate in vitro study, TF-1 cells expressing KIT D816V activating mutation demonstrated resistance to 1 and 10 uM imatinib treatment. Sensitivity was determined by assessing reduced mutant KIT auto-phosphorylation with addition of inhibitors. No reduction in D816V autophosphorylation was observed with inhibitor treatment.
38	EGFR:NM_005228:exon18:c.G2155A:p.G719S	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Gefitinib	Gefinitib has been shown to be effective in treating cell lines with G719S missense mutations.
39	EGFR:NM_005228:exon18:c.G2155A:p.G719S	Colorectal Cancer	Cetuximab	Whole genome sequencing of a case of colon carcinoma revealed a G724S mutation in the EGFR gene. In-vitro, this mutation was shown to be oncogenic and sensitive to Cetuximab, yet relatively insensitive towards small molecules. The same in-vitro results could be reproduced for the G719S mutation.
40	EGFR:NM_005228:exon18:c.G2155A:p.G719S	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Erlotinib,Gefitinib	This small clinical (n=56) study suggests that patients with minor mutations of EGFR, like G719S, are likely to have a moderate response to Tyrosine kinase inhibitors like Gefitinib and Erlotinib. In this study 44 of 56 patients were treated with either gefitinib or erlotinib. 35 patients had a G719 mutation but the majority of these were G719S (20 with G719S, 9 with G719A, 3 with G719C).
41	EGFR:NM_005228:exon18:c.G2155A:p.G719S	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Erlotinib	In an in vitro study, a Ba/F3 cell line expressing EGFR G719S demonstrated increased sensitivity to erlotinib treatment comparable to Ba/F3 cells expressing a known sensitizing mutation (EGFR L858R). Sensitivity was determined by assessing cell proliferation, the IC50 of erlotinib for EGFR G719S and EGFR L858R expressing cells were 16 nmol/L and 6 nmol/L, respectively.
42	EGFR:NM_005228:exon19:c.2235_2249del:p.E746_A750del	Bronchiolo-alveolar Adenocarcinoma	Erlotinib	EGFR exons 18-24 were analyzed in 7 patients who had shown a partial response to erlotinib in a phase II trial for bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC, or in situ pulmonary adenocarcinoma). One patient (Patient E2) had the E746_A750del mutation. The patient was a male never smoker, and demonstrated response for 8.5 months. Overall survival was 21+ months as the patient was alive at study end.
43	EGFR:NM_005228:exon19:c.2235_2249del:p.E746_A750del	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Gefitinib	In an in vitro study using PC9 cells (EGFR exon 19 deletion), inhibition of cell viability was used as an assay to determine sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. PC9 cells demonstrated an increased sensitivity to gefitinib (IC50: 23.0 nmol/L vs 200.0 nmol/L) compared to NCI-H2073 cells (EGFR wild type).
44	EGFR:NM_005228:exon19:c.2235_2249del:p.E746_A750del	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Gefitinib	Mutational profiling was performed on EGFR exons 18-24 from a group of 10 retrospectively chosen patients who had shown partial response or clinical improvement in response to gefitinib. Of 7 tumors with EGFR mutations, 4 were del E746-A750. 3 had adenocarcinoma with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) features, with response duration and overall survival of 8 and 15 months, 5+ and 5+ months (treatment ongoing at study end) and 28 and 30+ months (alive at study end), and one former smoker with adenocarcinoma with BAC features, who had response duration of 5+ months with treatment ongoing at study end.
45	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.2296_2297insTGGCCAGCG:p.V769_D770insASV	Lung Adenocarcinoma	Erlotinib	In this meta-analysis of 7 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of erlotinib, 1 patient with V769_770insASV had overall and progression-free survival of 642 days. From this and literature review it was concluded that although EGFR exon 20 insertions may confer reduced sensitivity to erlotinib, patients with this particular mutation appeared to benefit from therapy.
46	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Erlotinib	The T790M mutation in EGFR has been shown to confer resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib, and patients harboring this mutation that are placed on the drug are likely to relapse.
47	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Gefitinib	In non-small cell lung cancer, the appearance of T790M mutation leads to resistance to gefitinib.
48	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Dacomitinib	In Lung Cancer patients with acquired resistance to Dacomitinib (PF00299804), MET amplification and EGFR T790M were found to be the primary drivers of resistance.
49	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Erlotinib,Pemetrexed	In an NSCLC patient initially with L858R mutation, pemetrexed and cisplatin combination treatment was followed by erlotinib treatment. A slow progression developed which was found to be positive for L858R as well as T790M mutation which confers resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Due to slow tumor growth erlotinib was continued despite T790M, with re-addition of premetrexed, and this reduced tumor size and resulted in stable disease.
50	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Staurosporine	In NSCLC containing a T790M mutation, staurosporine may be inhibitive of EGFR, especially when an L858R mutation is also present.
51	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Cancer	Gefitinib,Multikinase Inhibitor AEE788	Lung cancers can accumulate activating mutations in oncogenes such as EGFR. The common L858R EGFR mutation has been shown previously to be sensitive to small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ie. erlotinib). In response, tumors may accumulate an additional 'gatekeeper' mutation in EGFR, T790M. Authors show that T790M retain low affinity for gefitinib and that introduction of T790M in the presence of L858R mutant increases the ATP affinity of L858R and activates wild-type EGFR, thus showing that increased ATP affinity is the primary mode of resistance in tumors with T790M, though irreversible ATP inhibitors (ie. HKI-272) are able to overcome this resistance via covalent bonding.
52	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Rociletinib	In a phase1-2 study, patients with the T790M mutation were more sensitive to rocelitinib in comparison to patients with T790M-negative NSCLC.
53	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Rociletinib	CO-1686 (Rociletinib) more effectively induced apoptosis in EGFR mutated (T790M and others) NSCLC cell lines than those harboring wildtype EGFR. CO-1686 also more effectively reduced tumor volume of mouse xenografts harboring the T790M than those with wildtype EGFR.
54	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Osimertinib	Cell line, xenograft, and transgenic models were used to establish Osimertinib as an inhibitor of both EGFR mutation sensitizing (L858M, del exon 19) and T790M resistance mutants. Preclinically, the drug inhibits signaling pathways and cellular growth in both EGFRm(+) and EGFRm(+)/T790M(+) mutant cell lines in vitro, with lower activity against wild-type EGFR lines. Sustained tumor regression was observed in EGFR-mutant tumor xenograft and transgenic models. Treatment of 2 patients with advanced EGFRm(+) T790M(+) NSCLC was reported as proof of principle.
55	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Osimertinib	This phase I/II trial (NCT01802632) involved 253 non-small cell lung cancer patients with activating EGFR mutations, who had progressed on first generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment, and were subsequently treated with Osimertinib (AZD9291). The overall objective tumor response rate was 51%. Among 127 patients with EGFR T790M who could be evaluated for response, the response rate was 61% (95% CI, 52 to 70). In contrast, among 61 patients without EGFR T790M, the response rate was 21% (95% CI, 12 to 34). The median progression-free survival was 9.6 months in EGFR T790M-positive patients and 2.8 months in EGFR T790M-negative patients.
56	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Osimertinib	This study summarized 9 EGFR-mutant patients from two clinical trials involving rociletinib (NCT01526928) and subsequent osimertinib (NCT01802632). 8 were T790M-positive prior to treatment with osimertinib. 6 transitioned directly from rociletinib to osimertinib. 3 patients achieved PR and 4 achieved SD. The median PFS was 208 days (95% CI, 41-208 days). Among 6 patients who transitioned directly from rociletinib to osimertinib all derived clinical benefit from osimertinib with either prolonged SD or PR.
57	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Osimertinib,Rociletinib	For cell harboring EGFR T790M mutation, osimertinib and rociletinib showed potent inhibition compared to erlotinib or afatinib. This study performed drug response assays using five human NSCLC cell lines with various combinations of EGFR mutations. In order to directly compare the sensitivity of multiple EGFR mutations to EGFR-TKIs the authors also generated multiple EGFR transduced Ba/F3 stable cell lines and evaluated sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs by MTS assay.
58	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Adenocarcinoma	Gefitinib,Erlotinib	155 patients with lung adenocarcinomas underwent rebiopsy and genotyping (EGFR, AKT1, BRAF, ERBB2, KRAS, MEK1, NRAS, PIK3CA and FISH for MET and HER2) after the development of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors (gefitinib or erlotinib). 98 patients were found to have developed EGFR T790M mutations.
59	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Adenocarcinoma	Osimertinib	Case report of a patient with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma and a 15–base pair deletion in EGFR exon 19. Partial response with erlotinib was achieved for 15 months after initial chemotherapy. After further progression, rebiopsy additionally identified the EGFR T790M mutation and the patient received several cycles of chemotherapy and targeted therapy including afatinib, cetuximab, erlotinib, AZD9291. She was treated with AZD9291 for 9 months until disease progression.
60	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Osimertinib	Osimertinib has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC.
61	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Gefitinib,Erlotinib	48 tumor samples from 41 patients with EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma that were resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibition by gefitinib (n=1) or erlotinib (n=40) underwent next generation sequencing (NGS failed in 5 samples leading to a remaining 43 specimens from 39 patients). The prevalence of various mutations post-treatment was analyzed. 79%, or 31 out of the 39 patients, had the T790M EGFR mutation present, indicating its importance in the development of resistance.
62	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Afatinib	Patients with advanced NSCLC and acquired resistance to EGFR TKI (gefitinib or erlotinib) were analyzed for T790M mutations.  Of the 70 patients analyzed, 36 (51%) had the T790M mutation and 34 (49%) were T790M-negative.  There was no significant difference in the median post-progression or overall survival between patients with T790M mutation and without T790M mutation for initial TKI treatment.  However, subsequent treatment with afatinib showed partial response in six patients where 1/21(5%) were in the T790M-positive group and 5/13 (38%) were in the T790M-negative group (P=0.01).
63	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Osimertinib	Randomized, international, open-label, phase 3 trial (NCT02151981) in 419 patients with T790M-positive advanced NSCLC and disease progression after first-line EGFR-TKI therapy. Patients were randomized, in a 2:1 ratio, to oral osimertinib or chemotherapy (pemetrexed plus either carboplatin or cisplatin every 3 weeks for up to six cycles, maintenance pemetrexed was allowed). Primary end point was PFS, which was significantly longer with osimertinib than with chemotherapy (10.1 months vs. 4.4 months; HR 0.30; 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.41; P<0.001). Objective response rate was significantly better with osimertinib (71%; 95% CI, 65 to 76) than with chemotherapy (31%; 95% CI, 24 to 40) (odds ratio for objective response, 5.39; 95% CI, 3.47 to 8.48; P<0.001).
64	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Adenocarcinoma	Osimertinib	In a lung adenocarcinoma patient harboring an EGFR E746_A750 mutation and an acquired EGFR T790M co-mutation, EGFR T790M was associated with sensitivity to osimertinib monotherapy. Prior to the development of the EGFR T790M mutation, the patient was treated with gefitinib and achieved a partial response, but subsequently tumor progression occurred; however, osimertinib treatment resulted a favorable tumor response with the extinguishment of the EGFR T790M mutation. In a stage IV lung adenocarcinoma patient harboring an EGFR L858R mutation and an acquired EGFR T790M co-mutation, EGFR T790M was associated with sensitivity to osimertinib monotherapy. Prior to the development of the EGFR T790M mutation, the patient was treated with erlotinib, followed by gefitinib for 12 months and achieved stable disease, but subsequently metastasis occurred; the EGFR T790M was then identified and subsequent 10 month treatment with osimertinib monotherapy resulted in a 45% disease regression.
65	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Gefitinib,Erlotinib	In a study of 6 patients with progressive non-small cell lung cancer during gefitinib or erlotinib therapy, comparison of DNA sequences from the original diagnostic biopsy specimen and a post-treatment biopsy specimen demonstrated that 3 patients acquired a new EGFR-T790M mutation. Analysis of EGFR sequence from 155 NSCLC samples prior to treatment with an EGFR inhibitor showed no T790M mutations, suggesting that T790M is associated with progression on gefitinib or erlotinib. In vitro experiments showed that the addition of T790M drastically reduced sensitivity to gefitinib or erlotinib in cells containing the sensitizing EGFR mutation L858R.
66	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Gefitinib	In a study of 14 patients with progressive non-small cell lung cancer during gefitinib treatment, comparison of DNA sequences from the original diagnostic biopsy specimen and the post-treatment biopsy specimen demonstrated that 7 patients acquired a new EGFR-T790M mutation. In addition, 52 pre-treatment tumours were examined with a sensitive real-time PCR assay and found no evidence of low frequency T790M mutation prior to gefitinib treatment.
67	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Lapatinib	In an in vitro study using NCI-H1666 cells (wildtype EGFR) and NCI-H1975 cells (EGFR-L858R/T790M), inhibition of cell growth was used as an assay to determine sensitivity to reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs. Cells with an EGFR L858R/T790M mutation demonstrated a reduced response to lapatinib (IC50: >4000nM vs. 534nM) compared to wildtype EGFR cells. Similarly, NIH-3T3 ectopically expression EGFR-L858R/T790M showed reduced sensistivity to lapatinib compared to EGFR wt or L585R mutant cells. These results were further confirmed in a Ba/F3 cell line model
68	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Dacomitinib	In an in vitro study using NCI-H322 cells (wildtype EGFR) and NCI-H1975 cells (EGFR-L858R/T790M), inhibition of cell growth was used as an assay to determine sensitivity to irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drugs. PF00299804 inhibited the growth of Ba/F3 cell lines containing the EFGR T790M resistance mutation as well as H1975 and H3255 cell lines that contain both EGFR L858R and T790M mutations and H820 containing an EGFR exon 19 deletion (Del 747_L751, Ins S) and a T790M mutation. All three cell lines were resistant to gefitinib in vitro, but sensitive to PF00299804 (IC50 <1 μmol/L for all three cell lines).
69	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Neratinib	The NSCLC cell line NCI-H1975 carrying the EGFR T790M mutation was resistant to erlotinib but showed increased sensitivity to HKI-272 (neratinib, IC50: 0.29 μmol/L). In an in vitro study Ba/F3 cells transfected with either EGFR-L858R or EGFR-L858R/T790M were used to assay cell growth. Ba/F3 cells require IL-3 in order to proliferate, but cells transfected with an activated oncogene are IL-3 independent. Cells with an EGFR L858R/T790M mutation demonstrated an improved response to neratinib (IC50: 0.185umol/L vs. >10umol/L) compared to the same cells treated with erlotinib.
70	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Afatinib	In an in vitro study using NCI-H1666 cells (wildtype EGFR) and NCI-H1975 cells (EGFR-L858R/T790M), inhibition of cell growth was used as an assay to determine sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drugs. Cells with an EGFR L858R/T790M mutation demonstrated an improved response to afatinib (IC50: 99nM vs. >4000nM) compared to the same cells treated with erlotinib. In an in vivo mouse xenograft study, the growth of cells with an EGFR-L858R/T790M mutation were more sensitive to treatment of afatinib (concentration: 15-20mg/kg) (median tumor volume = 75-150mm^3 vs. 1000mm^3), compared to reversible TKI lapatinib-treated xenografts. However, no complete responses were observed with afatinib alone.
71	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Afatinib	In an in vitro study using purified EGFR protein, kinase activity was assayed and compared for wildtype EGFR, EGFR-T790M and EGFR-T790M/L858R using both reversible and irreversible TKI drugs. EFGR proteins with T790M or T790M/L858R mutations were more sensitive to afatinib treatment (IC50: 9.8nM and 24nM, respectively vs. IC50: >1000nM and >1000nM, respectively) compared to treatment with erlotinib or lapatinib treatment. In an in vitro study using NCI-H358 cells (wildtype EGFR) and NCI-H1975 cells (EGFR-L858R/T790M), inhibition of cell growth was used as an assay to determine sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs. Cells with an EGFR L858R/T790M mutation demonstrated an improved response to afatinib (GI50: 42.0nM vs. >1000nM) compared to the same cells treated with erlotinib. However, IC50s were intermediate compared to a more potent pan-HER inhibitor.
72	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Canertinib	In an in vitro study using NCI-H1666 cells (wildtype EGFR) and NCI-H1975 cells (EGFR-L858R/T790M), inhibition of cell growth was used as an assay to determine sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drugs. Cells with an EGFR L858R/T790M mutation demonstrated an improved response to canertinib (IC50: 101nM vs. >4000nM) compared to the same cells treated with erlotinib. IC50 values of canertinib were comparable to afatinib.
73	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Cancer	Gefitinib,Erlotinib,Multikinase Inhibitor AEE788	Experimental - EGFR T790M mutation has been associated with resistance to first generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including erlotinib and gefitinib. In an in vitro study, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing EGFR T790M demonstrated resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib and the tool construct AEE788. These cells had very high IC50 nmol/L values for all three inhibitors in comparison to other constructs (Gefitinib>2000, Erlotinib>2000, AEE788>2000), indicating resitance to all three inhibitors.
74	EGFR:NM_005228:exon20:c.C2369T:p.T790M	Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma	Osimertinib	Patients with recurrent pancreatic adenocarcinoma was treated with gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel, FOLFIRINOX and docetaxel + irinotecan. After failure of these treatment, a tumor specimen from the pancreaticoduodenectomy was analysed, which revealed an activating mutation in exon 19 (L747_P753>S) of EGFR. Mutations were also detected in CDKN2A, TP53, and amplifications of PRKCI and TERC. He began erlotinib at 150mg daily. CT imaging  revealed a partial response by RECIST at 8, 24 and 32 weeks after starting erlotinib. At 40 weeks CT imaging revealed unequivocal disease progression. After disease progression to erlotinib, a repeat liver biopsy revealed an EGFR T790M mutation. He began treatment with osimertinib at 80mg daily. After 8 weeks of this treatment CT imaging revealed unequivocal disease progression.
75	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Gefitinib,Erlotinib	There is no statistical difference in progression free survival between lung cancer patients treated with gefitinib or erlotinib with EGFR L858R mutations (N=72/242; univariate: P=0.283; multivariate: P=0.250) compared to patients with Exon 19 mutations (N=170).
76	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Gefitinib,Erlotinib	In NSCLC patients treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the presence of L858R mutation is prognostic for better progression free survival.

78	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Adenocarcinoma	Afatinib	A phase III clinical trial (NCT00949650) found that median progression free survival among patients with exon 19 deletions or L858R EGFR mutations (n = 308) was 13.6 months for afatinib and 6.9 months for chemotherapy (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.65; P = 0.001).
79	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Adenocarcinoma	Afatinib	In a phase 2 study of patients with lung adenocarcinoma (stage IIIb with pleural effusion or stage IV) and EGFR mutations, treated with afatinib were assessed by objective response. 129 patients were treated with afatinib. 66% of the 106 patients with two common activating EGFR mutations (deletion 19 or L858R) had an objective response compared to 39% of 23 patients with less common mutations.
80	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Erlotinib	A randomized phase 3 trial (NCT00446225) involving 173 NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation in exon 21) with no history of chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either erlotinib or standard chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Median PFS was 9.7 months in the erlotinib group, compared with 5.2 months in the standard chemotherapy group.
81	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Afatinib	Cells harboring L858R were sensitive to afatinib. This study performed drug response assays using five human NSCLC cell lines with various combinations of EGFR mutations. In order to directly compare the sensitivity of multiple EGFR mutations to EGFR-TKIs the authors also generated multiple EGFR transduced Ba/F3 stable cell lines and evaluated sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs by MTS assay.
82	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Adenocarcinoma	Afatinib	Afatinib is an irreversible covalent inhibitor of EGFR (second generation). This Phase III clinical trial (LUX-Lung 6; NCT01121393) was performed in Asian patients with EGFR mutant advanced NSCLC. 364 eligible patients with EGFR mutations were assigned to afatinib (n=242) or gemcitabine and cisplatin (n=122) treatment. The trial observed significantly longer median progression-free survival with afatinib vs. gemcitabine and cisplatin treatment (11.0 vs. 5.6 months). Afatinib/Chemotherapy group compositions: 51.2/50.8 % del 19; 38/37.7 % Leu858Arg; 10.8/11.5 % Uncommon.
83	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Gefitinib	90 NSCLC patients with stage IIIB/IV chemotherapy-resistant tumors were treated with gefitinib, and the L858R EGFR mutation was associated with longer time to treatment failure than those with wild-type EGFR (median 9.1 versus 2.1). In multivariate analysis, L858R mutations plus adenocarcinoma was a significant predictive factor for time to treatment failure (HR = 0.1030; P = .0004).
84	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Gefitinib	In a phase 3 clinical trial of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, a subset of patients with EGFR mutations (n=44) treated with gefitinib were associated with improved progression free survival (HR: 0.16, 95% CI: 0.05-0.49, P=0.001), and a higher objective response rate (ORR: 42.1% vs 21.1%, p=0.04) compared to patients treated with docetaxel. Of the 44 patients, 22 had an exon 19 deletion, 16 had an L858R mutation, one patient had an exon 20 T790M mutation, two had an exon G719A mutation and four had other mutations.
85	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Adenocarcinoma	Gefitinib	Mutational profiling was performed on EGFR exons 18-24 from a group of 10 retrospectively chosen patients who had shown partial response or clinical improvement in response to gefitinib. Of 7 tumors with EGFR mutations, 1 was L858R. The patient was a female former smoker who had lung adenocarcinoma histology, and demonstrated response for 5 months, with overall survival 8 months.
86	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Lapatinib	In an in vitro study using NCI-H1666 cells (wildtype EGFR) and NCI-H3255 cells (EGFR-L858R), inhibition of cell growth was used as an assay to determine sensitivity to reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs. Cells with an EGFR L858R mutation demonstrated an improved response to lapatinib (IC50: 63nM vs. 534nM) compared to wildtype EGFR cells.
87	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Dacomitinib	In an in vitro study using NCI-H322 cells (wildtype EGFR) and NCI-H3255 cells (EGFR-L858R), inhibition of cell growth was used as an assay to determine sensitivity to irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drugs.

88	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Neratinib	In an in vitro study using NCI-H3255 cells (EGFR L858R), inhibition of cell growth was used as an assay to determine sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drugs. Cells with an EGFR L858R mutation demonstrated sensitivity to neratinib (IC50: 0.0049 μmol/L) compared to EGFRwt A549 cells (IC50 > 1 μmol/L).

Cells with an EGFR L858R mutation demonstrated an improved response to afatinib (IC50: 0.7nM vs. 60nM) compared to wildtype EGFR cells.
90	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Canertinib	In an in vitro study using NCI-H1666 cells (wildtype EGFR) and NCI-H3255 cells (EGFR-L858R), inhibition of cell growth was used as an assay to determine sensitivity to irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drugs. Cells with an EGFR L858R mutation demonstrated an improved response to canertinib (IC50: 1nM vs. 198nM) compared to wildtype EGFR cells.
91	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Erlotinib	In a phase II trial for bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC, or in situ pulmonary adenocarcinoma), EGFR exons 18-24 were analyzed in 7 patients who had shown a partial response to erlotinib. Two patients had the del L858R mutation. One patient was a male former smoker who demonstrated response for 3 months with overall survival of 3.5 months, and the other patient was a female never smoker who had response for 6 months and overall survival of 17+ months as the patient was alive at study end.
92	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Adenocarcinoma	Gefitinib	In a phase 3 clinical trial of Korean, never-smoker, lung adenocarcinoma patients, a subset of patients with EGFR mutations (n=42) treated with gefitinib were associated with improved overall response rate compared to gemcitabine plus cisplatin treatment (84.6%, 22/26, vs. 37.5%, 6/16, P=0.002). By contrast, in EGFR mutation negative cases, the response rate was much lower (25.9%, 7/27). The frequency of mutation in exon 19 deletion and L858R was 64.3% (27/42) and 36.4% (16/42), respectively. Exon 19 and L858R mutations were mutually exclusive in this cohort.
93	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Erlotinib	On May 14, 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved erlotinib (Tarceva) for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations.
94	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Afatinib	Afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of the ErbB family of tyrosine kinases has been approved in the US for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have tumours with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations as detected by a US FDA-approved test
95	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Cancer	Gefitinib,Multikinase Inhibitor AEE788,Erlotinib	EGFR L858R was expressed in Ba/F3 cells which do not contain endogenous EGFR, and conferred growth factor independance to the cells. Cells were plated and treated with 1st generation EGFR inhibitors Gefitinib, Erlotinib, or the the tool compound AEE788, and IC50 values were measured. L858R EGFR cells had very low IC50 nmol/L values for all three inhibitors in comparison to other constructs (Gefitinib=12, Erlotinib=6, AEE788=6), indicating sensitivity to all three constructs.
96	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Cancer	Erlotinib	MCF-7 cells were transduced with YFP tagged EGFR with E746_A750delELREA mutation, or YFP EGFR wildtype, and stained for ectopic YFP EGFR and phospho-Akt as a readout for EGFR pathway activity. Increased p-Akt stain was seen with ectopic mutant EGFR over wildtype cells. Parallel erlotinib incubations of cells with wildtype EGFR induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien only at high concentration (10uM). Addition of erlotinib to mutant EGFR cell incubations reduced p-Akt signal and induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien at considerably lower conecntration (100 nM) erlotinib.  These results indicate the EGFR L858R variant as a growth pathway driver targetable by erlotinib.
97	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Erlotinib	In an in vitro study using NCI-H1666 cells (wildtype EGFR) and NCI-H3255 cells (EGFR-L858R), inhibition of cell growth was used as an assay to determine sensitivity to reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs. Cells with an EGFR L858R mutation demonstrated an improved response to erlotinib (IC50: 40nM vs. 110nM) compared to EGFR wild type cells.
98	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Cancer	Erlotinib	In an in vitro study, a MCF-7 cell line expressing EGFR L858R mutation demonstrated sensitivity to erlotinib treatment, compared to MCF-7 cells expressing EGFR wild-type. Sensitivity was determined by assessing YFP signal-EGFR relocation.
99	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Erlotinib	In an in vitro study, Ba/F3 and NCI-H3255 cell lines expressing EGFR L858R demonstrated increased sensitivity to erlotinib treatment (IC50=0.006 and 0.068 µM). Sensitivity was determined by assessing cell proliferation, EGFR, AKT and ERK phosphorylation, levels of BIM (a marker of EGFR TKI-induced cell killing) and cell viability.
100	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Erlotinib	In an in vitro study, CHO and NCI-H3255 cells expressing EGFR L858R mutation were associated with sensitivity to erlotinib treatment. Sensitivity was determined by assessing cell density.
101	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Crizotinib	This study analyzed patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were positive for EML4-ALK fusions (ALK+) and progressed on crizotinib monotherapy. One patient was biopsied twice following crizotinib progression and once pre-treatment. This patient was a 27 year old female with one pack year who experienced partial response on crizotinib as 4th line therapy. The patient's pre-crizotinib biopsy was ALK+ and lacked the EGFR mutation. A biopsy taken after 63 days on crizotinib showed EGFR L858R mutation and lacked ALK gene rearrangement by FISH (ALK Loss). Of note, a second post-treatment biopsy (after 113 on crizotinib) showed ALK rearrangement but lacked EGFR mutation. The authors interpreted the emergence of an ALK negative tumor (first post-critozitinib biopsy) as evidence of a separate oncogenic driver (EGFR L858R).
102	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Adenocarcinoma	Erlotinib	In a prospective study of 46 Caucasian, advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients harboring EGFR mutations, first-line erlotinib treatment was assessed. Average PFS and OS for these 46 patients was 11 months (95% CI: 9.7-12.3 months) and 23 months (95% CI: 21.3-28.6+ months), respectively. A PFS rate of 81% at three months met the primary endpoint of presumed superiority over chemotherapy. Clinical benefit (CR+PR+SD) rate was 81%. Fifteen patients harbored EGFR L858R mutations, which was the only mutation found in exon 21. The authors note similar response profiles for exon 19 (27/46) and exon 21 mutations (15/46) to the overall population.
103	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Adenocarcinoma	Erlotinib	In an in vitro study, Ba/F3 cell line expressing EGFR L858R was associated with sensitivity to erlotinib treatment (IC50 26.9 ± 12.4). Sensitivity was determined by assessing cell viability, AKT and ERK phosphorylation, and EGFR auto-phosphorylation.
104	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Adenocarcinoma	Cetuximab	In an in vitro study, Ba/F3 cell line expressing EGFR L858R did not show sensitivity to cetuximab treatment, while cells expressing EGFR-RAD51 fusion were sensitive. Sensitivity was determined by assessing cell viability, AKT and ERK phosphorylation and EGFR auto-phosphorylation.
105	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Small Cell Carcinoma	Erlotinib	In an in vitro study using NCI-H3255 cells (EGFR L858R mutation), inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation was used as an assay to determine sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. NCI-H3255 cells demonstrated increased sensitivity to erlotinib (IC50: 8 and 11 nM) compared to EGFRwt NCI-H2073 cells (IC50: 108 nM; 95%CI 52-223 nM).
106	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Osimertinib	In an in vitro study using NCI-H3255 cells (EGFR L858R mutation), inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation was used as an assay to determine sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. NCI-H3255 cells demonstrated increased sensitivity to AZD9291 (IC50: 60 and 49 nM) compared to EGFRwt NCI-H2073 cells (IC50: 1865 nM; 95%CI 872-3988 nM). In vivo experiments with NCI-H3255 xenograft models showed drastic tumour volume reduction upon treatment with 5mg/kg/day AZD9291.
107	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	High Grade Glioma	Erlotinib	In an in vitro study, a Ba/F3 cell line expressing EGFR L858R demonstrated increased sensitivity to erlotinib treatment, compared to Ba/F3 cells expressing EGFR wild-type. Variant function was assessed by EGFR auto-phosphorylation. Sensitivity was assessed by cell viability assay using stable transfection of each variant and increasing concentrations of erlotinib (0–10 uM).
108	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Dacomitinib	The authors pooled patients with exon 19 deletion and L858R EGFR (Exon 21) mutations from both studies (The ARCHER 1009 (NCT01360554) and A7471028 (NCT00769067)) to compare the efficacy of dacomitinib to erlotinib. 121 patients with any EGFR mutation were enrolled, 101 had activating mutations in exon 19 or 21. For those (exon19/21), the median PFS was 14.6 months with dacomitinib and 9.6 months with erlotinib The median survival was 26.6 months with dacomitinib versus 23.2 months with erlotinib.
109	EGFR:NM_005228:exon21:c.T2573G:p.L858R	Lung Adenocarcinoma	Gefitinib	In a Japanese Phase III clinical trial, noninferiority of Gefitinib as compared to Erlotinib was assessed in 561 postoperative recurrent or stage IIIb/VI patients who had undergone prior chemotherapy treatment but no tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. In a subset of patients with sole EGFR L858R, there was an insignificant difference between the objective response and disease control rates for patients treated with erlotinib (N=67) and gefitinib (N=78). Progression free survival was also not significantly different and did not meet the noninferiority endpoint with Gefitinib and Erlotinib arms at 8.1 and 8.5 months, respectively (HR, 0.938; 95% CI, 0.675 to 1.304; P = .704).
110	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Melanoma	Mirdametinib,Trametinib	In the setting of BRAF(V600E), NF1 loss resulted in elevated activation of RAS-GTP but does not show resistance to MEK inhibitors.
111	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Colorectal Cancer	Sorafenib,Panitumumab	Cetuximab or panitumumab may be ineffective in patients with BRAF mutation unless BRAF inhibitor such as Sorafenib is introduced.
112	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Melanoma	Vemurafenib	In the setting of BRAF(V600E), NF1 loss resulted in elevated activation of RAS-GTP and resistance to RAF inhibitors.
113	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Dabrafenib	In a patient with V600E-positive NSCLC, KRAS G12D seemed to confer resistance to dabrafenib.
114	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Melanoma	Dabrafenib,Trametinib	Dabrafenib with trametinib provides higher response rate and lower toxicity (as compared to chemotherapy) in patients with melanoma.
115	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Colorectal Cancer	Pictilisib Bismesylate,PLX4720	Combined PI3K inhibitor GDC0941 and BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 administration to NSG mice subcutanousely injected with colorectal cell lines with a BRAF V600E mutation effectively inhibited tumor growth and reduced cellular proliferation.
116	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Colorectal Cancer	Nutlin-3,PLX4720	Combined nutlin-3 and PLX4720 administration to athymic nude mice subcutanousely injected with the A357 colorectal cell line with a BRAF V600E mutation effectively inhibited tumor growth significantly more than single agent therapy.
117	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Colorectal Cancer	Bevacizumab,Capecitabine,Vemurafenib	This in vivo study examined the efficacy of various treatments on athymic nude mice xenografted with colorectal cancer HT29 cells, which harbor BRAF V600E. The authors sought to understand whether the addition of vemurafenib (a BRAF V600E inhibitor) to agents approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer increased therapeutic efficacy, and which combinations worked best. Capecitabine, bevacizumab and vemurafenib combination therapy resulted in 100% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and 190% increased lifespan (ILS) compared to vehicle treated controls. Seven mice experienced partial response and two experienced complete response. Triplet therapy resulted in better TGI and ILS compared to any agent in isolation or capecitabine + vemurafenib doublet therapy (p <0.05, p <0.0001, for all comparisons).
118	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Colorectal Cancer	Vemurafenib	This preclinical study examined vemurafenib efficacy on various colorectal cancer cell lines and in mouse xenograft experiments. Of the cell lines tested, six harbored BRAF V600E (and WT KRAS) and three harbored BRAF WT (but mutant KRAS). Of the six BRAF V600E expressing cell lines, four were sensitive to vemurafenib (IC50 ranging between 0.025 and 0.35 uM; HT29, Colo205, Colo741, LS411N). Cell lines expressing the BRAF V600E mutation responded better to vemurafenib treatment than cells wildtype for BRAF as measured by reduced cellular proliferation and inhibition of MET and ERK phosphorylation (none of the three BRAF wt cell lines had IC50s less than 10uM). Authors note that one of the vemurafenib-resistant cell lines harboring BRAF V600E (RKO) harbored a concurrent activating PIK3CA H1047R mutation. Nude, athymic mice with HT29 xenografts treated with vemurafenib experienced substantial tumor inhibition and increased lifespan at every dose tested, though authors found 75 mg/kg twice daily to be optimal (95% tumor growth inhibition, 90% increased lifespan compared to vehicle treated controls).
119	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Colorectal Cancer	Cetuximab	This was a retrospective study of 691 cetuximab treated patients with metastatic, chemotherapy refractory colorectal cancer. Of those, 30 patients harbored BRAF V600E, were KRAS, NRAS and PIK3CA wt, and had individual response data. One patient (who harbored BRAF V600E in low copy number) responded, 11 had stable disease, and 18 progressed. Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=20), cetuximab monotherapy (n=5), cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=4), and cetuximab + oxaliplatin + 5FU (n=1). Median PFS was 8 weeks (2-32 weeks), median OS was 25 weeks (4-237 weeks), and median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 2 (0-4). Median age was 61 years old (42-78) and there were 16 males and 14 females. Authors concluded that BRAF mutation (23/24 of mutants were BRAF V600E) was strongly associated with poor response to cetuximab and suggested that mutation status of BRAF is more informative than those of NRAS and PIK3CA exon 20 for predicting cetuximab response (second only to KRAS).
120	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Melanoma	Pictilisib	One patient with BRAF V600E mutated melanoma (with no detected PI3K pathway deregulation) had a partial response on treatment with pictilisib, a PI3K inhibitor, for 9.5 months. Study was a phase-1 with 60 patients enrolled.
121	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Colorectal Cancer	Panitumumab,Cetuximab	This meta-analysis of 7 randomized control trials evaluating overall survival (OS) (8 for progression free survival) could not definitely state that survival benefit of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies is limited to patients with wild type BRAF. In other words, the authors believe that there is insufficient data to justify the exclusion of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy for patients with mutant BRAF. In these studies, mutant BRAF specifically meant the V600E mutation.
122	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Melanoma	MEK Inhibitor RO4987655	This was a phase I expansion and pharmacodynamic study of oral MEK inhibitor RO4987655 on advanced cancer. Of 17 patients with BRAF V600E melanoma, 4 achieved partial response, 5 experienced stable disease lasting longer than 16 weeks, and 8 experienced disease progression (including 2 with prior vemurafenib treatment). One of the partial responders had a concomitant EGFR mutation, and two of the stable disease patients had other concomitant mutations (in RET or MET). The median days on treatment was 113 (18-366) for BRAF V600E melanoma patients and 107 (17-323) for BRAF V600 wildtype patients (n=23). Patients with BRAF V600E mutant melanoma experienced similar response rates (24% vs 20%) and rates of metabolic response measured by decrease in FDG uptake assessed by FDG-PET (86% vs 75%) compared to non-BRAF mutant patients. Patients with melanoma, either BRAF wt or V600E, experienced significant decreases in Ki67 expression by day 15 of MEK inhibitor treatment (P<0.02). The authors conclude that RO4987655 has clinical activity in BRAF V600E and BRAF wt melanoma.
123	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Melanoma	Selumetinib,Dactolisib	49 BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines from patients not previously treated with BRAF inhibition were analyzed. 21 exhibited primary resistance to BRAF inhibition using PLX4720. Inhibition of MEK1/2 (AZD6244 [selumetinib]) and PI3K/mTOR (BEZ235 [dactolisib]) was the most effective approach to counteract resistance in comparison to inhibition with the PLX4720 (progenitor of vemurafenib)-BEZ235 (where response was assessed by apoptosis, viability, p-ERK, p-Akt inhibition).
124	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Cancer	Cobimetinib	Preclinical study analyzing the differential response to MEK inhibitors in KRAS and BRAF mutant cancer cell lines and mouse xenografts. Inhibition of active, phosphorylated MEK by GDC-0973 (cobimetinib) is required for strong inhibition of the MAPK pathway in BRAF-mutant tumours. This study provides mechanistic rationale for improved efficacy of cobimetinib in BRAF-mutant models compared to MEK inhibitors acting through an alternative mechanism (GDC-0623 and G-573).
125	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Melanoma	Vemurafenib	The BRIM-3 Phase III trial NCT01006980 assessed BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib versus dacarbazine in 598 patients with treatment naive metastatic melanoma and confirmed V600E mutation. Significant differences were seen in overall survival (13.3 months with vemurafenib vs. 10.0 months with dacarbazine) and median progression free survival (6.9 months  with vemurafenib vs. 1.6 months with dacarbazine)
126	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Colorectal Cancer	Vemurafenib	In this Phase II pilot study (NCT00405587) of BRAF V600 inhibitor vemurafenib in 21 metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with BRAF V600E, one patient had a durable 21 week partial response, and seven patients had 8 week stable disease as best response. Median progression free survival was 2.1 months and median overall survival was 7.7 months. The authors conclude that single agent vemurafenib did not show meaningful activity in V600E CRC, in contrast to the significant vemurafenib activity against V600 in melanoma.
127	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Colorectal Cancer	Dabrafenib	In trial NCT00880321, dabrafenib was tested in various solid tumor types harboring mutant BRAF after establishing dosage of 150 mg twice daily. In nine colorectal cancer patients with established V600E mutation, 1 confirmed response, 7 instances of stable disease, and 1 case of progressive disease was seen, which contrasted strongly with a 56% confirmed response rate seen in metastatic V600E melanoma patients similarly treated in the same study.
128	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Colorectal Cancer	Vemurafenib,Gefitinib,Cetuximab	5 of 7 colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines with BRAF V600E mutation were resistant to treatment with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. An RNAi screen in the WiDr cell line (a V600E CRC line) identified EGFR as an enhancer for survival when exposed to vemurafenib.  Treatment with vemurafenib and EGFR inhibitor (cetuximab or gefitinib) in V600E CRC cells (WiDr, VACO432 and KM20) showed inhibited growth as well as induction of the cleaved PARP apoptotic marker. WiDr and VACO432 cells were injected into immunodeficient mice. Modest response was seen with vemurafenib treatment, while combination treatment showed considerable tumor growth inhibition as compared to control.
129	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Skin Melanoma	Vemurafenib	Phase 3 randomized clinical trial comparing vemurafenib with dacarbazine in 675 patients with previously untreated, metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation. At 6 months, overall survival was 84% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78 to 89) in the vemurafenib group and 64% (95% CI, 56 to 73) in the dacarbazine group. A relative reduction of 63% in the risk of death and of 74% in the risk of either death or disease progression was observed with vemurafenib as compared with dacarbazine (P<0.001 for both comparisons).
130	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Skin Melanoma	Vemurafenib	Phase 2 trial in 132 patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation.  Confirmed overall response rate was 53% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44 to 62; 6% with a complete response and 47% with a partial response), median duration of response was 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 8.6), and median progression-free survival was 6.8 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 8.1). Median overall survival was 15.9 months (95% CI, 11.6 to 18.3).
131	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Colorectal Cancer	Panitumumab,Vemurafenib	Treatment response to mutant BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and EGFR inhibitor panitumumab was assayed in 12 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who had progressed on chemotherapy. Two patients had confirmed partial responses, and 2 showed stable disease over 6 months. The authors conclude that although some efficacy is seen, only a small subset of patients respond to this treatment and the responses are not durable.
132	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Thyroid Gland Papillary Carcinoma	Vemurafenib	A 73 year old patient with prior history of breast cancer presented with metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma. After two treatments of I-131 a comprehensive tumor profile revealed BRAF V600E as the only genetic alteration on a near diploid genome with trisomy 1q. Vemurafenib treatment resulted in improvement of symptoms and considerable reductions in tumor mass, and after 23 months the patient remained on therapy with well controlled disease.
133	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Melanoma	Vemurafenib,Cobimetinib	In this Phase III trial (coBRIM, NCT01689519) of 495 V600 mutant melanoma patients, 344 had V600E mutation. 174 patients were treated with vemurafenib and placebo, and 170 were treated with vemurafenib and cobimetinib and tested for progression free survival. 88 of 174 monotherapy group patients had an event with median progression free survival of 6.5 months. In the combination group 58 of 174 patients had an event with median progression-free survival not met, however, when in combination with other V600 mutations median progression-free survival was 9.9 months with combination treatment. Median time to followup for the whole cohort was 7.3 months. Hazard Ratio for progression or death was 0.57 (0.41-0.80).
134	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Colorectal Cancer	GDC-0879,Dactolisib	In a mouse model of BRAF V600E colorectal cancer, western blots from tumors in mice treated with BRAF inhibitor GDC-0879 and PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 showed stronger reduction in phospho-Akt and phospho-S6 than PI3K/mTOR inhibitor alone, and combination inhibition also resulted in stronger phospho-ERK inhibition in tumors than did BRAF inhibition alone. Increased apoptosis in tumors was seen in dual treatment conditions with increased TUNEL-positive cells. In vehicle treated mice, area of colon covered by tumor increased, while treatment with single agent inhibitors caused growth inhibition resulting in no change in colon area covered by tumors. Administration of dual inhibitors induced tumor regression apparent in a decrease of colonic area covered by tumors over the course of treatment.
135	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumor	Vemurafenib,Dabrafenib,Trametinib	BRAF mutations were identified in 9% of 108 cases of high-grade colorectal neuroendocrine tumors (80% V600E). Two patients were treated with a combination of BRAF and MEK inhibition and exhibited durable response (beyond 7 and 9 months, respectively). Urinary BRAF V600E tumor DNA correlated with disease response in one of the patients. BRAF and MEK inhibition was either dabrafenib+trametinib (case 1) or vemurafenib+trametinib (case 2).

Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive encorafenib, binimetinib, and cetuximab (triplet-therapy group); encorafenib and cetuximab (doublet-therapy group); or the investigators’ choice of either cetuximab and irinotecan or cetuximab and FOLFIRI. The median overall survival was 9.0 months in the triplet-therapy group and 5.4 months in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.70; P<0.001). The confirmed response rate was 26% (95% CI, 18 to 35) in the triplet-therapy group and 2% (95% CI, 0 to 7) in the control group (triplet group vs. control P<0.001). The median progression-free survival in the triplet-therapy group was 4.3 months (95% CI, 4.1 to 5.2) and 1.5 months (95% CI, 1.5 to 1.7) in the control group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.49; P<0.001).
178	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Colorectal Cancer	Irinotecan,Cetuximab,Vemurafenib	This in vivo study examined the efficacy of various treatments on athymic nude mice xenografted with colorectal cancer HT29 cells, which harbor BRAF V600E. The authors sought to understand whether the addition of vemurafenib (a BRAF V600E inhibitor) to agents approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer increased therapeutic efficacy, and which combinations worked best. Irinotecan, cetuximab and vemurafenib combination therapy resulted in >100% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and 250% increased lifespan (ILS) compared to vehicle treated controls. Of the ten treated mice, nine experienced partial response and one experienced a complete response. Compared to all doublet and single agent combinations of vemurafenib, irinotecan, and cetuximab, triplet therapy produced the best TGI and ILS (p<0.05, p <0.0001 for all comparisons).
179	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Colorectal Cancer	Vemurafenib,Erlotinib	This in vivo study examined the efficacy of various treatments on athymic nude mice xenografted with colorectal cancer HT29 cells, which harbor BRAF V600E. The authors sought to understand whether the addition of vemurafenib (a BRAF V600E inhibitor) to agents approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer increased therapeutic efficacy, and which combinations worked best. Erlotinib and vemurafenib combination therapy resulted in >100% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and 142% increased lifespan (ILS) compared to vehicle treated controls. Of ten treated mice, 9 experienced partial response. Doublet therapy produced a greater increase in TGI and ILS than either agent in isolation.
180	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Thyroid Gland Papillary Carcinoma	Vemurafenib	Open label phase 2 (Clinical Level B) trial including patients from across the globe (USA, Italy, and the Netherlands) investigating sensitivity to Vemurafenib in patients that have BRAF V600E-positive papillary thyroid cancer that have become resistant to radioactive iodine (the standard treatment). There were 116 patients identified for this trial, 51 of which met the conditions to be included. These 51 patients were split into two cohorts: 1) patients that had never been treated with a multikinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR and 2) patients that have previously been treated with a VEGFR multikinase inhibitor. In cohort 1, ten of 26 patients had best overall response. Best overall response was defined as the proportion of patients with a complete or partial response, however these ten patients were all partial response. In the same cohort 1, nine had achieved stable disease control for at least six months; therefore, 19 patients achieved disease control (73% of total cohort 1, 95% CI 52-88). In cohort 2, of 23 eligible patients, six had a partial response as best overall response and six had stable disease control for at least six months; therefore, 12 patients achieved disease control. (55% of total cohort 2, 95% CI 32-76). The authors conclude that vemurafenib is a potential treatment option for late-stage BRAF V600E-positive papillary thyroid cancer for treatment in patients naïve to a multikinase inhibitor (Cohort 1) and to patients that have been previously treated with a multikinase inhibitor (Cohort 2).
181	BRAF:NM_004333:exon15:c.T1799A:p.V600E	Colorectal Cancer	Encorafenib,Cetuximab	The open-label phase 3 BEACON CRC trial included 665 patients with BRAF V600E-mutated metastatic CRC. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive encorafenib, binimetinib, and cetuximab (triplet-therapy group); encorafenib and cetuximab (doublet-therapy group); or the investigators’ choice of either cetuximab and irinotecan or cetuximab and FOLFIRI. The median overall survival was 8.4 months (95% CI, 7.5 to 11.0) in the doublet-therapy group and 5.4 months (95% CI, 4.8 to 6.6) in the control group, with a significantly lower risk of death compared to the control group (hazard ratio for death doublet-group vs. control, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.79; P<0.001). The confirmed response rate was 26% (95% CI, 18 to 35) in the triplet-therapy group, 20% in the doublet-therapy group (95% CI 13 to 29) and 2% (95% CI, 0 to 7) in the control group (doublet group vs. control P<0.001). Median PFS was 4.2 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 5.4) in the doublet-therapy group, and 1.5 months (95% CI, 1.5 to 1.7) in the control group (hazard ratio for disease progression doublet-group vs control, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.52, P<0.001).
182	KRAS:NM_004985:exon4:c.G436A:p.A146T	Colorectal Cancer	Selumetinib,Dactolisib	In 28 out of 40 (70%) metastatic colorectal cancer tumors implanted into mice, the therapeutic combination of the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 and the PI3K/mTor inhibitor BEZ235 resulted in disease stabilization. Mean tumor growth was lower in the tumors treated with AZD6244+ BEZ235 (+77% vs. +267%, P=1E-6) compared to AZD6244 alone and (+77% vs. +222%, P=0.0014) BEZ235 alone. 32/40 tumors harbored KRAS mutations including 2 A146T tumors (1 also harboring PIK3CA E545K) which both showed disease stabilization during doublet therapy but progression on either single agent.
183	KRAS:NM_004985:exon4:c.G436A:p.A146T	Colorectal Cancer	Cetuximab	Preclinical data supporting resistance of Exon 4 mutations, in particular A146T, to cetuximab and sensitivity to PD0325901. This study involved treatment of mice bearing A146T KRAS xenografts treated with PD0325901 or cetuximab.
184	KRAS:NM_004985:exon4:c.G436A:p.A146T	Colorectal Cancer	FOLFOX-4 Regimen,Cetuximab	In a retrospective study of 148 treatment naive metastatic colorectal cancer patients, patients with RAS mutations and wildtype BRAF (n=10), including A146T (N=3), G15D (N=1), and V152M/NRAS V160A, treated with FOLFOX4 plus cetuximab were associated with decreased overall survival (16.3mo vs. 28.5mo, HR:0.43, 95% CI:0.20-0.89, P=0.020) and decreased progression free survival (7.2mo vs. 9.7mo, HR:0.56, 95% CI:0.27-1.16, P=0.11), as compared to patients with wild-type KRAS, NRAS and BRAF.
185	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G38A:p.G13D	Colorectal Cancer	Cetuximab	Cells harboring KRAS G13D mutation were sensitive to cetuximab treatment in isogenic SW48 cells and in a mouse xenograft model.
186	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G38A:p.G13D	Colorectal Cancer	Cetuximab	KRAS G13D mutation is associated with better response to Cetuximab with longer progression-free and overall survival in colorectal patients compared to other KRAS.
187	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G38A:p.G13D	Colorectal Cancer	Cetuximab	This is a retrospective analysis of 98 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and KRAS mutations. 23 (23.5%) had KRAS p.G13D-mutated tumors. Of the 98 patients, 31 patients received cetuximab, of these, 9 (29.0%) had KRAS p.G13D mutations. Univariate analysis did not show any differences between these groups. Multivariate analysis showed a trend towards better PFS among patients with a G13D mutation (PFS: HR=0.29; 95% CI: 0.08-1.10; P=0.07; OS: HR=0.23; 95% CI: 0.04-1.54; P=0.13).
188	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G38A:p.G13D	Colorectal Cancer	Cetuximab	12 patients with KRAS G13D mutant, metastatic colorectal cancer were treated with single agent cetuximab in a prospective phase II study. The primary endpoint of the trial was 4-month progression-free survival, with a benefit to treatment evaluated to be 50% of patients were progression free at this point. None of 12 patients achieved response by RECIST 1.1 criteria and three patients (25%) were progression-free at 4 months, with disease control rate at 6 months reaching 0%. Median PFS and OS were 1.9 (95% CI 1.7–3.8) and 7.2 months (95% CI 5.7–9.7).
189	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G38A:p.G13D	Colorectal Cancer	Cetuximab	Meta-analysis encompassing eight randomized controlled trials (n = 5967) for assessment of both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with KRAS mutant metastatic colorectal cancer. For other KRAS MT the hazard ratio for OS benefit with addition of anti-EGFR mAb therapy was 1.06 (95% confidence interval [CI]; 0.96, 1.17), compared to 1.08 (95% CI; 0.73, 1.60) for KRAS G13D [test for interaction p=0.99]. In contrast, the hazard ratio for KRAS wild-type (WT) tumours was 0.85 (95% CI; 0.76, 0.95). Regarding PFS benefit with anti-EGFR mAbs, the hazard ratio was 1.07 (95% CI; 0.92, 1.26) for other KRAS MT, 0.96 (95% CI; 0.73, 1.27) for KRAS G13D, and 0.68 (95% CI; 0.54, 0.85) for KRAS wild-type. Again, the test for interaction (p=0.46) demonstrated no significant difference in PFS benefit for anti-EGFR mAb therapy between KRAS G13D and other KRAS MT.
190	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G38A:p.G13D	Breast Cancer	Pictilisib	This preclinical study tested the efficacy on several breast cancer cell lines of GDC-0941 (pictilisib), a selective inhibitor of all four isoforms of class I PI3-kinases over a range of IC50 values. Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. MDA-MB-231 is a basal-type breast cancer cell line which harbors KRAS G13D, and it had an ICD50 of 20uM. To evaluate in vivo efficacy, cells were injected in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice and allowed to grow. Mice injected with MDA-MB-231 and treated with pictilisib saw no reduction in tumor volume compared to untreated control. There was no effect on G1 arrest in pictilisib treated cells; however, phosphorylated AKT (S473) was substantially reduced following pictilisib. Authors note that basal breast cancer cell lines were generally more resistant to pictilisib than luminal lines (p=0.02), and concluded that this cell line was resistant to pictilisib.
191	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G38A:p.G13D	Colorectal Cancer	Panitumumab	Three patients participating in a large retrospective study of EGFR monoclonal antibodies in metastatic, treatment refractory colorectal cancer had tumors which harbored KRAS G13D, were wildtype for NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA, and had individual response data. All three patients were males treated with panitumumab monotherapy. Their characteristics are as follows: 51 year old who experienced progressive disease (PFS: 8 weeks; OS: 24 weeks) and had three prior lines of chemotherapy; 54 year old who experienced progressive disease (PFS: 8 weeks; OS: 17 weeks) and had two prior lines of chemotherapy; 52 year old who experienced stable disease (PFS: 12 weeks; OS: 46 weeks) and had two prior lines of chemotherapy. Per the authors criteria, the clinical benefit rate is 1/3 and the response rate is 0/3.
192	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G38A:p.G13D	Colorectal Cancer	Dactolisib,Selumetinib	In 28 out of 40 (70%) metastatic colorectal cancer tumors harboring KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA or BRAF mutations and implanted into mice, the therapeutic combination of the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 and the PI3K/mTor inhibitor BEZ235 resulted in disease stabilization. Mean tumor growth was lower in the tumors treated with AZD6244+ BEZ235 (+77% vs. +267%, P=1E-6) compared to AZD6244 alone and (+77% vs. +222%, P=0.0014) BEZ235 alone. 32/40 mice harbored KRAS mutations including 5 G13D mutations where disease stabilization was achieved in 2/5 mice treated with AZD6244 or combination therapy and 0/5 mice treated with BEZ235 alone.
193	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G38A:p.G13D	Colorectal Cancer	Cetuximab	In an in vitro study, a Lim1215 colorectal cancer cell line endogenously expressing KRAS G13D mutation demonstrated resistance to cetuximab treatment, compared to Lim1215 parental cells expressing wild-type KRAS. Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability.
194	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G38A:p.G13D	Colorectal Cancer	Cetuximab	This was a retrospective study of 691 cetuximab treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Of those, 50 patients harbored KRAS G13D, were BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA wt, and had individual response data. Nine patients had partial response, 19 had stable disease, and 22 progressed. Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=38), cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=5), cetuximab monotherapy (n=4), cetuximab + oxaliplatin + 5FU (n=2), and cetuximab + irinotecan + oxaliplatin + 5FU (n=1). Median PFS was 16 weeks (3-101 weeks), median OS was 33 weeks (3-161 weeks), and median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 2 (0-4). Median age was 65 years old (34-78), and there were 29 males and 20 females. Authors concluded that KRAS mutation was strongly associated with poor response to cetuximab and suggested that mutation status of KRAS is the most informative compared to BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 for predicting cetuximab response.
195	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G38A:p.G13D	Colorectal Cancer	Cetuximab	In a retrospective study of 148 treatment naive metastatic colorectal cancer patients, patients with RAS mutations (n=10), including KRAS A146T, KRAS G13D, NRAS G12D and NRAS Q179*, treated with FOLFOX4 plus cetuximab were associated with decreased overall survival (16.3mo vs. 28.5mo, HR:0.43, 95% CI:0.20-0.89, P=0.020) and decreased progression free survival (7.2mo vs. 9.7mo, HR:0.56, 95% CI:0.27-1.16, P=0.11), as compared to patients with wild-type KRAS and NRAS.
196	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G38A:p.G13D	Colorectal Cancer	Regorafenib	In an in vitro study, a human colon adenocarcinoma SW48 cell line expressing KRAS G13D mutation demonstrated resistance to regorafenib treatment (IC50: 172.23 nM vs. 114.28 nM, P<0.01) compared to SW48 cells expressing KRAS wild-type. Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability. Authors concluded that KRAS G13D is more resistant to regorafenib than KRAS wt, but more sensitive than common KRAS G12 mutations.
197	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G38A:p.G13D	Colorectal Cancer	Panitumumab,Cetuximab	In this study, a large cohort of metastatic colorectal cancer patients were treated with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab or panitumumab). KRAS, PIK3CA, and PTEN were tested for mutation; KRAS G13D was the only variant noted in the primary colon tumors of two patients who experienced partial response following treatment (Patients 37, 47; Supplemental Table 1). In the larger cohort, patients with tumors harboring any KRAS mutation had significantly decreased incidence of objective response than patients with wtKRAS tumors. Authors noted that patients with tumors harboring KRAS mutations tended to have decreased PFS and OS compared to those with wild-type tumors though the differences were not statistically significant.
198	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G38A:p.G13D	Colorectal Cancer	Panitumumab,Cetuximab	In this study, a large cohort of metastatic colorectal cancer patients were treated with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab or panitumumab). KRAS G13D was the only variant noted in the primary rectal tumor of one patient who experienced disease progression following treatment (Patient 45; Supplemental Table 1). This is response is consistent with observations made of the larger cohort, where patients with tumors harboring any KRAS mutation had significantly decreased incidence of objective response than patients with wtKRAS tumors. Authors noted that patients with tumors harboring KRAS mutations tended to have decreased PFS and OS compared to those with wild-type tumors though the differences were not statistically significant. However, two other patients (37 and 47; Table S1) had G13D as their only noted variant, but experienced partial response.
199	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G35A:p.G12D	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	Selumetinib,Dactolisib	The use of NVP-BEZ235 in conjunction with ARRY-142886, but not as monotherapy, in a lung cancer model with KRAS G12D mutation led to marked tumor regression.
200	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G35A:p.G12D	Pancreatic Carcinoma	Akt Inhibitor MK2206	Among 33 patients treated with pan-AKT inhibitor MK-2206 in this phase 1 study, one patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and PTEN loss and a KRAS G12D mutation experienced a decrease of approximately 60% in cancer antigen 19-9 levels and 23% shrinkage in tumor measurements.
201	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G35A:p.G12D	Hairy Cell Leukemia	Vemurafenib	One patient enrolled in a clinical study to evaluate vemurafenib treatment of BRAF V600E mutant hairy-cell leukemia developed resistance to vemurafenib retreatment. 300-gene targeted sequencing of the patient’s genome revealed activating subclonal KRAS mutations (KRAS G12D, 15.2% allele frequency; KRAS K117N, 1.2%), as well as a RUNX1 A55E mutation (5.9%) that had not been seen prior to vemurafenib treatment or at remission. BRAF V600E allele frequency was detectable (2.4%) at the time of remission but dramatically increased at relapse (64.9%).
202	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G35A:p.G12D	Colorectal Cancer	Therapeutic Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes	A patient with metastatic colorectal cancer was enrolled in a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT01174121). 24 cultures of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were expanded from 3 lung metastasis resections. After cultures were tested for reactivity, the patient was infused with 1.48 x 10^11 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (75% CD8+ T cells) that were specifically reactive to KRAS G12D. All 7 metastatic lung lesions regressed 40 days after therapy, and the patient had a 9-month partial response.
203	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G35A:p.G12D	Colorectal Cancer	Panitumumab	One patient participating in a large retrospective study of EGFR monoclonal antibodies in metastatic, treatment refractory colorectal cancer had a tumor which harbored KRAS G12D, was wildtype for NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA, and had individual response data. This patient was was a 55 year old female treated with panitumumab monotherapy as 3rd line therapy who experienced progressive disease (PFS: 8 weeks; OS: 9 weeks).
204	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G35A:p.G12D	Colorectal Cancer	Cetuximab	This was a retrospective study of 691 cetuximab treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Of those, 76 patients harbored KRAS G12D, were BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA wt, and had individual response data. Five patients had partial response, 34 had stable disease, and 37 progressed. Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=61), cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=6), cetuximab monotherapy (n=5), cetuximab + oxaliplatin + 5FU (n=2), cetuximab + 5FU (n=1), cetuximab + oxaliplatin + bevacizumab (n=1). Median PFS was 12 weeks (3-169 weeks), median OS was 31 weeks (6-232 weeks), and median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 2 (0-5). Median age was 62 years old (32-86), and there were 43 males and 33 females. Using these data and data from the larger cohort, authors concluded that KRAS mutation was strongly associated with poor response to cetuximab and suggested that mutation status of KRAS is the most informative compared to BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 for predicting cetuximab response.
205	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G35A:p.G12D	Colorectal Cancer	Selumetinib,Dactolisib	In 28 out of 40 (70%) metastatic colorectal cancer tumors harboring KRAS, NRAS, BRAF or PIK3CA mutations and implanted into mice, the therapeutic combination of the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 and the PI3K/mTor inhibitor BEZ235 resulted in disease stabilization. Mean tumor growth was lower in the tumors treated with AZD6244+ BEZ235 (+77% vs. +267%, P=1E-6) compared to AZD6244 alone and (+77% vs. +222%, P=0.0014) BEZ235 alone. 32/40 tumors studied had KRAS mutations with 9 G12D (2 with PIK3CA H1047R) and 13 other G12 mutations.
206	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G35A:p.G12D	Colorectal Cancer	Panitumumab	In a retrospective study of 427 metastatic colorectal patients, KRAS mutations were observed in 43% of the tumor samples. Patients with mutations in codon 12 or 13 of KRAS were associated with reduced response to panitumumab compared to wildtype KRAS (HR:0.99, 95% CI:0.73-1.36 vs. HR:0.45, 95% CI:0.34-0.59; P<0.0001). Additionally, patients with KRAS mutations showed no significant improvement between treatment with panitumumab and best supportive care alone (PFS: 7.4 wk vs 7.3 wk).
207	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G35A:p.G12D	Lung Cancer	Gefitinib	In recurrent lung cancer patients treated with the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib, patients with KRAS mutations had a lower frequency of partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) and a higher rate of progressive disease (PD) (PR:0, SD:1, PD:15 vs. PR:24, SD:8, PD:14; P=0.0274) compared to wildtype KRAS patients. Patients with KRAS mutations also had a shorter overall survival compared to wildtype KRAS patients (HR:2.542, 95% CI:1.048-6.168, P=0.0390).
208	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G35A:p.G12D	Multiple Myeloma	Melphalan	In a study of patients receiving melphalan-based therapy, those with KRAS codon 12 mutations were less likely to have a positive response than those with wildtype KRAS (26.9% vs. 58.3%, P=0.015).
209	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G35A:p.G12D	Multiple Myeloma	Melphalan	In in vitro experiments, myeloma cell lines expressing activating NRAS and KRAS mutations are less sensitive to the apoptosis-inducing effects of dexamethasone, doxorubicin, and melphalan in comparison to cells with wildtype RAS.
210	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G35A:p.G12D	Multiple Myeloma	Melphalan	In in vitro experiments, myeloma cell lines expressing activating NRAS and KRAS mutations are less sensitive to the apoptosis-inducing effects of dexamethasone, doxorubicin, and melphalan in comparison to cells with wildtype RAS.
211	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G35A:p.G12D	Multiple Myeloma	Melphalan	In in vitro experiments, myeloma cell lines expressing activating NRAS and KRAS mutations are less sensitive to the apoptosis-inducing effects of dexamethasone, doxorubicin, and melphalan in comparison to cells with wildtype RAS.
212	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G35A:p.G12D	Colorectal Cancer	Regorafenib	In an in vitro study, a human colon adenocarcinoma SW48 cell line expressing KRAS G12D mutation demonstrated resistance to regorafenib treatment (IC50: 195.01nM vs. 114.28 nM P<0.01) compared to SW48 cells expressing KRAS wild-type. Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability. Authors concluded that KRAS G12D was more resistant to regorafenib than KRAS wt, and intermediately resistant compared to other common KRAS G12/G13 mutations.
213	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G35A:p.G12D	Melanoma	Vemurafenib	In vitro studies of M229 (a human melanoma cell line) endogenously expressing wildtype KRAS and BRAF V600E (a known BRAF inhibitor sensitizing mutation) found that cells virally induced to stably over-express KRAS4a G12D or KRAS4b G12D  were more resistant to vemurafenib (a BRAF inhibitor) than cells transduced with empty vectors (90% vs 10% survival).
214	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G35A:p.G12D	Ovarian Cancer	Cetuximab	In an in vitro study, a MCAS cell line expressing KRAS G12D mutation was associated with reduced sensitivity to cetuximab treatment as compared to RMUG-L and OMC-1 cells expressing wild-type KRAS. Resistance was determined by assessing cell growth. Further, in an in vivo experiment, KRAS G12D expressing MCAS xenografts in nude mice had reduced response to cetuximab, as compared to KRAS wild-type expressing RMUG-L xenografts. Resistance was determined by assessing tumor growth.
215	KRAS:NM_004985:exon2:c.G35A:p.G12D	Colorectal Cancer	Panitumumab,Cetuximab	In this study, a large cohort of metastatic colorectal cancer patients were treated with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab or panitumumab). KRAS, PIK3CA, and PTEN were tested for mutation; KRAS G12D was the only variant noted in the primary tumor of two patients who experienced stable disease  following treatment (Patients 22 and 36; colon and rectum tumors; Supplemental Table 1). In the larger cohort, patients with tumors harboring any KRAS mutation had significantly decreased incidence of objective response than patients with wtKRAS tumors. Authors noted that patients with tumors harboring KRAS mutations tended to have decreased PFS and OS compared to those with wild-type tumors though the differences were not statistically significant.
216	MAP2K1:NM_002755:exon2:c.A167C:p.Q56P	Melanoma	Selumetinib	A375 cells expressing MAP2K1 Q56P mutation conferred an approximately 100-fold increased resistance to selumetinib (AZD6244) induced growth inhibition when compared to untransduced cells, cells expressing wild-type MAP2K1, or cells expressing a constitutively active form. This mutation also attenuated pERK inhibition by selumetinib in these cells.
